            " and fluctuations in the availability of parts and materials will continue to have an adverse impact on\n\nour ability to generate revenue, despite strong demand from our customers. Furthermore, in some cases, our efforts to identify and secure alternative supply chain sources have resulted in our customers or their end customers requiring requalification and validation of components, a process that can often be lengthy and has negatively impacted the timing of our revenue. In addition, we expect the near-term inventory correction that our optical communications customers are experiencing to persist, which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue.\n\nRevenues by Geography\n\nWe generate revenues from three geographic regions: North America, Asia-Pacific and others, and Europe. Revenues are attributed to a particular\n\ngeographic area based on the bill-to location of our customers, notwithstanding that the products may be shipped to a different geographic region. The substantial majority of our revenues are derived from our manufacturing facilities in Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America decreased from 66.1% in the three months ended December 29, 2023 to 55.3% in the three months ended December 27, 2024, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in the United States.\n\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America decreased from 64.2% in the six months ended December 29, 2023 to 58.4% in the six months ended December 27, 2024, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in the United States.\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the short and medium-term indications and forecasts from our customers, we expect that the portion of our future revenues attributable to\n\ncustomers in regions outside North America for the remainder of fiscal year 2025 will be in line with the portion of revenues attributable to such customers during the six months ended December 27, 2024.\n\nThe following table presents percentages of total revenues by geographic region:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nDecember 27, 2024\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nDecember 27, 2024\n\nDecember 29, 2023\n\nNorth America Asia-Pacific and others Europe\n\n44.7 % 47.3 8.0 100.0 %\n\n33.9 % 60.3 5.8 100.0 %\n\n41.6 % 50.7 7.7 100.0 %\n\n35.8 % 57.3 6.9 100.0 %\n\nOur Contracts\n\nWe enter into supply agreements with our customers which generally have an initial term of up to three years, subject to automatic renewals for\n\nsubsequent one-year terms unless expressly terminated. Although there are no minimum purchase requirements in our supply agreements, our customers provide us with rolling forecasts of their demand requirements. Our supply agreements generally include provisions for pricing and periodic review of pricing, consignment of our customer\u2019s unique production equipment to us, and the sharing of benefits from cost-savings derived from our efforts. We are generally required to purchase materials, which may include long lead-time materials and materials that are subject to minimum order quantities and/or non-cancelable or non-returnable terms, to meet the stated demands of our customers. After procuring materials, we manufacture products for our customers based on purchase orders that contain terms regarding product quantities, delivery locations and delivery dates. Our customers generally are obligated to purchase finished goods that we have manufactured according to their demand requirements. Materials that are not consumed by our customers within a specified period of time, or that are no longer required due to a product\u2019s cancellation or end-of-life, are typically designated as excess or obsolete inventory under our contracts. Once materials are designated as either excess or obsolete inventory, our customers are typically required to purchase such inventory from us even if they have chosen to cancel production of the related products. The excess or obsolete inventory is shipped to the customer and recognized as an offset against cost of revenue upon shipment.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nThe key components of our cost of revenues are material costs, employee costs, and infrastructure-related costs. Material costs generally represent the majority of our cost of revenues. Several of the materials we require to manufacture products for our customers are customized for their products and often sourced from a single supplier or in some cases, our own subsidiaries. Shortages from sole-source suppliers due to yield loss, quality concerns and capacity constraints, among other factors, may increase our expenses and negatively impact our gross profit margin or total revenues in a given quarter. Material costs include scrap material. Historically, scrap rate diminishes during a product\u2019s life cycle due to process, fixturing and test improvement and optimization.\n\nA second significant element of our cost of revenues is employee costs, including indirect employee costs related to design, configuration and optimization of manufacturing processes for our customers, quality testing"

Our provision for income tax reflects an effective tax rate of 3.2% and 1.4% for fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2021,\n\nrespectively. The increase was primarily due to higher income subject to tax as well as more income subjected to tax in jurisdictions with higher tax rate in fiscal year 2022, as compared to fiscal year 2021.\n\nNet income. We recorded net income of $200.4 million, or 8.8% of total revenues, for fiscal year 2022, compared with net income of $148.3 million,\n\nor 7.9% of total revenues, for fiscal year 2021.\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss). We recorded other comprehensive loss of $6.5 million, or 0.3% of revenues, for fiscal year 2022, compared with other comprehensive loss of $5.1 million, or 0.3% of revenues, for fiscal year 2021. The increase in other comprehensive loss was mainly due to (1) higher unrealized loss from mark-to-market of available-for-sale debt securities of $5.1 million, and (2) unrealized loss from foreign currency translation adjustment of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2022, as compared to unrealized gain from foreign currency translation adjustment of $0.6 million for fiscal year 2021; offset by lower unrealized loss from mark-to-market of forward contracts and interest rate swap agreement of $4.5 million.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash Flows and Working Capital\n\nWe primarily finance our operations through cash flow from operating activities. As of June 30, 2023 and June 24, 2022, we had cash, cash\n\nequivalents, and short-term investments of $550.5 million and $478.2 million, respectively, and outstanding debt of $12.2 million and $27.4 million, respectively.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, are placed with banks and other financial institutions. The weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents for fiscal year 2023, fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2021 was 2.4%, 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.\n\nOur cash investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the audit committee of our board of directors. In general, our\n\ninvestment policy requires that securities purchased be rated A1, P-1, F1 or better. No security may have an effective maturity that exceeds three years.

The Company bases estimates on historical experience and various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on available information. The Company\u2019s reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under different conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to significant accounting policies, which are discussed below. Significant assumptions are used in accounting for share-based compensation, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for expected credit losses, income taxes, inventory obsolescence, goodwill and valuation of intangible assets related to business acquisition, among others. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates. In the event that the Company's estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments will be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Additionally, the extent to which the evolving COVID- 19 pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements will depend on a number of factors, including the magnitude and duration of the pandemic. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, or based upon the occurrence of other factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that could result in material impacts to the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal years\n\nThe Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday in June closest to June 30.

Fiscal year 2023 will comprise 53 weeks and will end on June 30, 2023.\n\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standard Board issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-10, \u201cGovernment Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,\u201d which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions involving government assistance, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity\u2019s financial statements. The amendments in this update are effective for all entities within the ASU's scope for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021.

        "ground_truth": "Indirect costs that affect prolongation calculations include site management, utilities, or equipment, which are often referred to as preliminaries or overheads. These costs are more sensitive to the duration of the project than to specific work tasks and serve to support the entire project.",

            " the continued deployment of its project management team, supervisory staff, resources, and plant and equipment. Accordingly, in this claim, McDermott is seeking reimbursement for these additional costs incurred during the extended period of the Project.\n\nThe costs incurred in construction projects refers to the cost required for materials, labor, equipment, permits, and other essential items, as well as recurring expenses to keep the site operational. These costs are often classified into two main categories:\n\nProject expenses that can be clearly and directly attributed to a specific unit of work (commonly referred to as 'measured work', 'direct work', or 'task-related costs'); and\n\nExpenses that cannot be directly assigned (often referred to as 'preliminaries', 'overheads', or 'indirect costs').\n\nPreliminaries, overheads or indirect resources are site overheads for carrying out direct work. The American Association of Cost Engineers defines them as:\n\n\u201cCosts not directly attributable to the completion of an activity, which are typically allocated or spread across all activities on a predetermined basis.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026costs which do not become a final part of the installation, but which are required for the orderly completion of the installation and may include, but are \n\n\n\nnot limited to, field administration, direct supervision, capital tools, start-up costs, Contractor's fees, insurance, taxes, etc.\u201d\n\nAlso, the American Association of Cost Engineers defines \u2018Overhead\u2019 as;\n\nOVERHEAD \u2013 A cost or expense inherent in the performing of an operation, (e.g., engineering, construction, operating, or manufacturing) which cannot be charged to or identified with a part of the work, product or asset and, therefore, must be allocated on some arbitrary base believed to be equitable, or handled as a business expense independent of the volume of production. See also: GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS (G&A). (May 2012)\n\nThe Paragraph 20.1 of the SCL delay & disruption protocol states that the compensation for prolongation resulting from Employer risk events will primarily comprise the Consortium\u2019s extended use of time-related resources.\n\n\u201cDelay causes prolongation. Prolongation causes increased cost. The recoverability of compensation for prolongation depends on the terms of the contract and the cause of the prolongation. Obviously, any prolongation costs resulting from Contractor Risk Events must be borne by the Contractor. Compensation for prolongation resulting from Employer Risk Events will primarily comprise the Contractor\u2019s extended use of time-related resources, notably its site overheads. It is, however, not possible to say that compensation for prolongation comprises exclusively additional time-related resources because other types of recoverable loss may result from Employer Risk Events\u201d.\n\nAs per the standard practice of construction claims, only \u2018time-related indirect costs\u2019 are considered for the calculation of prolongation costs. The reasons are that the \u2018time\u2019 is variable in prolongation cost and therefore time-related indirect costs are considered for the same.\n\n\n\nThe task-related indirect costs and direct costs are not part of the prolongation costs as they are not directly linked with the prolongation.\n\nFigure 2 - Type of Cost\n\nDirect costs refer to labor, materials, and equipment that can be easily linked to specific tasks within the project. Once these tasks are completed and paid for, the contractor is generally assumed to have recovered the costs associated with them.\n\nExamples of Direct Costs include:\n\nRaw materials used in manufacturing a product.\n\nLabour costs of workers directly involved in execution.\n\nSpecific equipment or machinery rental for a particular Project.\n\nIndirect costs, however, include general project expenses that can\u2019t be assigned to a specific task, such as site management, utilities, or equipment. These are often referred to as preliminaries or overheads and are more sensitive to the duration of the project than to specific work tasks. They serve to support the entire project, but they\u2019re not tied to any one unit of work.\n\n\n\nExamples of Indirect Costs include:\n\nrent or lease of office space, which may be used for various departments and activities.\n\nutilities like electricity, water, and internet for the office.\n\nsalaries of administrative staff who support multiple departments.\n\nOffice supplies / equipment used by multiple employees across various functions.\n\nThe Prolongation costs are but are not limited to, time-related site expenses due to extended stay/prolongation, additional Head Office Overheads for the extended stay, and loss of opportunity to make profits.\n\nProlongation costs have been considered under the following major heads, details of which have been furnished in subsequent Sections of this Report.\n\nA1: On-Site Time-related Cost.\n\nA"

        "ground_truth": "Inflation and government efforts to combat inflation, such as raising the benchmark interest rate, could increase market volatility and have an adverse effect on the financial market and global economy.",
        "contexts": [
            ".\n\nThe current volatility and adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets have negatively affected levels of business and consumer spending, heightening concerns about the likelihood of a global recession and potential default of various national bonds and debt backed by individual countries. Such developments, as well as the policies impacting these, could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 has led to reduced demand in some of our customers\u2019 optical communications product portfolios and significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates. Uncertainty about worldwide economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may further reduce or postpone spending in response to reduced budgets, tight credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and increase the volatility of our share price. In addition, our ability to access capital markets may be restricted, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions and could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, inflation increased globally to levels not seen in decades. Although inflation rates have recently declined, inflation can adversely\n\naffect us by increasing the costs of labor and other expenses. There is no assurance that our revenues will increase at the same rate to maintain the same level of profitability. Inflation and government efforts to combat inflation, such as raising the benchmark interest rate, could increase market volatility and have an adverse effect on the financial market and global economy. In addition, we expect that disruptions in our supply chain and fluctuations in the availability of parts and materials will continue to have a significant impact on our ability to generate revenue, despite strong demand from our customers. Such adverse conditions could negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our shareholders.\n\nWe anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our\n\nworking capital and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for at least the next 12 months. However, we operate in a market that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. If this occurs, we may need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies.\n\nFurthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our shareholders\n\ncould be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders. If adequate additional funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our manufacturing services, hire additional technical and other personnel, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited.\n\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets.\n\nWe use professional investment management firms to manage our excess cash and cash equivalents. Our short-term investments as of September 27, 2024 are primarily investments in a fixed income portfolio, including liquidity funds, certificates of deposit and time deposits, corporate debt securities, and U.S. agency and U.S. Treasury securities. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital markets. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. The policy also provides that we may not invest in short-term investments with a maturity in excess of three years.\n\nShould financial market conditions worsen, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit\n\nconcerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of September 27, 2024, we did not record any impairment charges associated with our portfolio of short-term investments, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.\n\n46\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are not fully insured against all potential losses. Natural disasters or other catastrophes could adversely affect our business, financial\n\ncondition and operating results.\n\nOur current property and casualty insurance covers loss or damage to our property and third-party property over which we have custody and control, as well as losses associated with business interruption, subject to specified exclusions and limitations such as coinsurance, facilities location sub-limits and other policy limitations and covenants.

The Company submitted an update to OFAC on November 16, 2021 reporting on the results of its review of those transactions. The Company intends to continue to cooperate fully with OFAC in this matter going forward.

The determination of these segments is based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics.\n\nAn operating segment's performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include intangible amortization, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, legal and other, and interest, net and other charges, net. A portion of depreciation is allocated to the respective segments, together with other general corporate research and development and administrative expenses.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSelected financial information by segment is in the table below.\n\nThree-Month Periods Ended\n\nNine-Month Periods Ended\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n(In millions)\n\nNet sales:\n\nFlex Agility Solutions Flex Reliability Solutions Nextracker Intersegment eliminations\n\n$\n\n$\n\n3,466 $ 2,956 710 (29) 7,103 $\n\n4,029 $ 3,225 516 (14) 7,756 $\n\n10,685 $ 9,561 1,763 (99) 21,910 $\n\n12,024 9,493 1,384 (",

During the first half of fiscal year 2023, the Company accrued for certain loss contingencies where losses are considered probable and estimable.\n\nCorporate and other primarily includes corporate service costs that are not included in the chief operating decision maker's (\"CODM\") assessment of the\n\nperformance of each of the identified reportable segments.\n\nThe Company provides an overall platform of assets and services, which the segments utilize for the benefit of their various customers. The shared assets and services are contained within the Company's global manufacturing and design operations and include manufacturing and design facilities. Most of the underlying manufacturing and design assets are co-mingled in the operating campuses and are compatible to operate across segments and highly interchangeable throughout the platform. Given the highly interchangeable nature of the assets, they are not separately identified by segment nor reported by segment to the Company's CODM.\n\n15. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\n\nIn October 2023, the Company\u2019s management committed to targeted restructuring activities to improve operational efficiencies by reducing excess workforce capacity. During the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $74 million and $100 million of restructuring charges, respectively, most of which related to employee severance.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table summarizes the provisions, respective payments, and remaining accrued balance as of December 31, 2023 for charges incurred\n\nduring the nine-month period ended December 31, 2023:\n\nSeverance\n\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\n\nOther Exit Costs\n\nBalance as of March 31, 2023\n\n$\n\n44 $\n\n(In millions) \u2014 $\n\n6 $\n\nProvision for charges incurred during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2023 Cash payments during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2023 Non-cash reductions during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2023 Other adjustments\n\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 Less: Current portion (classified as other current liabilities)\n\nAccrued restructuring costs, net of current portion (classified as other liabilities)\n\n$\n\n93 (84) \u2014 (1) 52 51\n\n1 $\n\n5 \u2014 (5) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 $\n\n2 \u2014 \u2014 (1) 7 7 \u2014 $\n\n16. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\n\nPrior to the Spin-off, the Company controlled Nextracker Inc. (\"Nextracker\") through its holding of Class B common stock that did not participate in the\n\nearnings of Nextracker. As such, the shareholders of the equity at risk in Nextracker (the Class A common stock shareholders) did not have the power to direct the key activities of Nextracker and consequently Nextracker was a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). The Company had the ability to control Nextracker's activities through its control of 51.4% and 61.4% of the voting rights of Nextracker as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The Company also had the ability to receive significant benefits from the VIE (through its ability to convert its investments in Nextracker and Nextracker LLC into Class A common stock of Nextracker or cash) and as such the Company had been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As such, the Company continued to consolidate Nextracker and the interests in Nextracker held by third parties are presented as a noncontrolling interest prior to the Spin-off. Evaluation of the VIE model and identification of the primary beneficiary requires significant judgements to be made regarding which entities can control the activities of a VIE, who can receive benefits or absorb losses from the"

        "question": "What problems occur with Chonburi's expansion causing excess capacity and lower yields?",
        "ground_truth": "If the expansion at Chonburi leads to excess capacity, it could harm the business, financial condition, and operating results. Lower yields can occur due to factors such as the quality of input materials and equipment, the quality and feasibility of customer designs, the repeatability and complexity of the manufacturing process, the experience and quality of training of manufacturing and engineering teams, and the monitoring of the manufacturing environment.",
        "contexts": [
            " If our customers do not believe that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity, they may: (1) outsource all of their production to another manufacturer that they believe can fulfill all of their production requirements; (2) look to a second manufacturer for the manufacture of additional quantities of the products that we currently manufacture for them; (3) manufacture the products themselves; or (4) decide against using our services for their new products.\n\nMost recently, we expanded our manufacturing capacity by building a new facility at our Chonburi campus in Thailand in 2022. We may continue to devote significant resources to the expansion of our manufacturing capacity, and any such expansion will be expensive, will require management\u2019s time and may disrupt our operations. In the event we are unsuccessful in our attempts to expand our manufacturing capacity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\n\nHowever, if we successfully expand our manufacturing capacity but are unable to promptly utilize the additional space due to reduced demand for\n\nour services or an inability to win new projects, add new customers or penetrate new markets, or if the optics industry does not grow as we expect, we may experience periods of excess capacity, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe may experience manufacturing yields that are lower than expected, potentially resulting in increased costs, which could harm our business,\n\noperating results and customer relations.\n\nManufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\n\n\nthe quality of input, materials and equipment;\n\n\n\nthe quality and feasibility of our customer\u2019s design;\n\n\n\nthe repeatability and complexity of the manufacturing process;\n\n\n\nthe experience and quality of training of our manufacturing and engineering teams; and\n\n\n\nthe monitoring of the manufacturing environment.\n\nLower volume production due to continually changing designs generally results in lower yields. Manufacturing yields and margins can also be lower if we receive or inadvertently use defective or contaminated materials from our suppliers. In addition, our customer contracts typically provide that we will supply products at a fixed price each quarter, which assumes specific production yields and quality metrics. If we do not meet the yield assumptions and quality metrics used in calculating the price of a product, we may not be able to recover the costs associated with our failure to do so. Consequently, our operating results and profitability may be harmed.\n\n48\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIf the products that we manufacture contain defects, we could incur significant correction costs, demand for our services may decline and we\n\nmay be exposed to product liability and product warranty claims, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and customer relations.\n\nWe manufacture products to our customers\u2019 specifications, and our manufacturing processes and facilities must comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. In addition, our customers\u2019 products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them are often complex. As a result, products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or fail to be in compliance with applicable statutory or regulatory requirements. Additionally, not all defects are immediately detectable. The testing procedures of our customers are generally limited to the evaluation of the products that we manufacture under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons (including, among others, the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable at the time of testing or that are detected only when products are fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions), these products may fail to perform as expected after their initial acceptance by a customer.\n\nWe generally provide a warranty of between one to five years on the products that we manufacture for our customers. This warranty typically guarantees that products will conform to our customers\u2019 specifications and be free from defects in workmanship. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or by deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, and whether such defects are discovered during or after the warranty period, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation, whether or not we are indemnified for such failures. We could also incur significant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. In some instances, we may also be required to incur costs to repair or replace defective products outside of the warranty period in the event that a recurring defect is discovered in a certain percentage of a customer\u2019s products delivered over an agreed upon period of time. We have experienced product or component failures in the past and remain exposed to such failures, as the products that we manufacture are widely deployed throughout the world in multiple environments and applications. Further, due to the difficulty in determining whether a given defect resulted from our customer\u2019s design of the product or our manufacturing process, we may be exposed to product liability or product warranty claims arising from defects that are not attributable to our manufacturing process. In addition, if the number or type of defects exceeds certain percentage limitations contained in our contractual arrangements, we may"

As our customers change the way they go to market, we have the capability to reorganize and rebalance our business portfolio in order to align with our customers' needs and requirements in an effort to optimize operating results. The objective of our business model is to allow us to be flexible and redeploy and reposition our assets and resources as necessary to meet specific customers' supply chain solution needs across all the markets we serve and earn a return on our invested capital above the weighted average cost of that capital.\n\nWe believe that our continued business transformation is strategically positioning us to take advantage of the long-term, future growth prospects for\n\noutsourcing of advanced manufacturing capabilities, design and engineering services and after-market services.\n\nWe are continuously evaluating our capital structure in response to the current environment and expect that our current financial condition, including\n\nour liquidity sources are adequate to fund future commitments.

We also are monitoring and responding to the Israel-Hamas war. As of the date of this report, there is no material impact to our business operations and financial performance in Ukraine and Israel. The full impact of the conflicts on our business operations and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflicts and their impact on regional and global economic conditions. We will continue to monitor the conflicts and assess the related restrictions and other effects and pursue prudent decisions for our team members, customers, and business.\n\nOther Developments\n\nOn July 3, 2023, our subsidiary Nextracker Inc. (\"Nextracker\") completed a follow-on offering to its initial public offering, which was completed on February 13, 2023, and issued 15,631,562 shares of Class A common stock and received net proceeds of $551 million. The entire net proceeds were used by Nextracker to acquire 14,025,000 Nextracker LLC common units from Yuma, Inc., our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, and 1,606,562 Nextracker LLC common units from TPG Rise Flash, L.P., an affiliate of the global alternative asset management firm TPG. As a result of the repurchase of Nextracker LLC common units by Nextracker, 15,631,562 shares of Nextracker Class B common stock were cancelled. Subsequent to the follow-on offering, we owned 74,432,619 shares of Class B common stock, representing 51.5% of the total outstanding shares of Nextracker common stock and, accordingly, continued to control Nextracker. We received approximately $495 million from the follow-on offering, after distribution of net proceeds to TPG and expenses.\n\nOn October 25, 2023, we announced our plan to effect a Spin-off of all of our remaining interests in Nextracker to our shareholders on a pro rata basis\n\npursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 7, 2023 (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d).\n\nOn January 2, 2024, we completed the Spin-off of our remaining interests in Nextracker to Flex shareholders on a pro rata basis based on the number\n\nordinary shares of Flex held by each shareholder of Flex (the \u201cDistribution\u201d) as of December 29, 2023, which was the record date of the Distribution. Under the previously disclosed terms of the Spin-off, Flex shareholders received approximately 0.17 shares of Nextracker Class A common stock for every Flex ordinary share held as of the record date of the Distribution. Flex shareholders received cash in lieu of any fractional shares.\n\nAs a result of the completion of the Spin-off, Nextracker became a fully independent public company, we no longer directly or indirectly hold any shares of Nextracker common stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Nextracker"

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling $740.6 million and $550.5 million as of December 29, 2023 and\n\nJune 30, 2023, respectively. We have interest rate risk exposure relating to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the original dates of purchase. The cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held for working capital purposes. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We have not been exposed nor do we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in market interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, will reduce future investment income. If overall interest rates had declined by 10 basis points during the six months ended December 29, 2023 and December 30, 2022, our interest income would have decreased by approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, assuming consistent investment levels.\n\nWe also have interest rate risk exposure in movements in interest rates associated with our interest-bearing liabilities. The interest-bearing liabilities are denominated in U.S. dollars. Until September 29, 2023, the interest expense was based on LIBOR, plus an additional margin, depending on the lending institution. If the LIBOR had increased by 100 basis points during the six months ended December 29, 2023 and December 30, 2022, our interest expense would have increased by approximately $0.1 million for both periods, assuming consistent borrowing levels. As a result of the phase-out of LIBOR, we amended the Term Loan Agreement to replace the interest rate reference from LIBOR to the SOFR effective from September 29, 2023 (see Note 10).\n\nWe therefore entered into interest rate swap agreements (the \u201cSwap Agreements\u201d) to manage this risk and increase the profile of our debt obligation. The terms of the Swap Agreements, one of which matured in June 2023, allow us to effectively convert the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate. This locks the variable interest expenses associated with our floating rate borrowings and results in fixed interest expenses that are unsusceptible to market rate increases. We designated the Swap Agreements as a cash flow hedge, and they qualify for hedge accounting because the hedges are highly effective. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in our earnings. From September 27, 2019, any gains or losses related to these outstanding interest rate swaps will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, with subsequent reclassification to interest expense when settled.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio in a variety of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. government and agency bonds, corporate obligations, money market funds, asset-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities. The majority of these investments pay a fixed rate of interest. The securities in the investment portfolio are subject to market price risk due to changes in interest rates, perceived issuer creditworthiness, marketability, and other factors. These investments are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nInvestments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market values of our fixed-\n\nrate securities decline if interest rates rise, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may be less than we expect because of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nAs a result of our foreign operations, we have significant expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies.

            " short-term investments.\n\nFinancing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of repayment of long-term debt, share repurchases, and withholding tax related to net share settlement of\n\nrestricted share units. Cash used in financing activities was lower for the three months ended September 29, 2023 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to no share repurchases and a decrease in withholding tax related to net share settlement of restricted share units, and lower of the repayment of long-term borrowings due to one fewer installment from one fewer week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on\n\nus.\n\n37\n\nTable of Contents\n\nITEM 3.

            "\ufffd) of complex products, such as optical communication components, modules and sub-systems, automotive components, industrial lasers, medical devices and sensors. We offer a broad range of advanced optical and electro-mechanical capabilities across the entire manufacturing process, including process design and engineering, supply chain management, manufacturing, complex printed circuit board assembly, advanced packaging, integration, final assembly, and testing. We focus primarily on low-volume production of a wide variety of high complexity products, which we refer to as \u201clow-volume, high-mix.\u201d We also have the capability to accommodate high-volume production. Based on our extensive experience and the positive feedback we have received from our customers, we believe we are a global leader in providing these services to the optical communications, automotive, and industrial lasers markets.\n\nOur customer base includes companies in complex industries that require advanced precision manufacturing capabilities such as optical\n\ncommunications, automotive, industrial lasers, and sensors. The products that we manufacture for our OEM customers include selective switching products; tunable lasers, transponders and transceivers; active optical cables; solid state, diode-pumped, gas and fiber lasers; and sensors. In many cases, we are the sole outsourced manufacturing partner used by our customers for the products that we manufacture for them.\n\nWe also design and fabricate application-specific crystals, lenses, prisms, mirrors, laser components, and substrates (collectively referred to as\n\n\u201ccustomized optics\u201d) and other custom and standard borosilicate, clear fused quartz, and synthetic fused silica glass products (collectively referred to as \u201ccustomized glass\u201d). We incorporate our customized optics and glass into many of the products we manufacture for our OEM customers, and we also sell customized optics and glass in the merchant market.\n\nRevenues\n\nWe believe we are able to expand our relationships with existing customers and attract new customers due to, among other factors, our broad range of complex engineering and manufacturing service offerings, flexible low-cost manufacturing platform, process optimization capabilities, advanced supply chain management, excellent customer service, and experienced management team. Although we expect the prices we charge for our manufactured products to decrease over time (partly as a result of competitive market forces), we believe we will be able to continue to maintain favorable pricing for our services because of our ability to reduce cycle time, adjust our product mix by focusing on more complicated products, improve product quality and yields, and reduce material costs for the products we manufacture. We believe these capabilities have enabled us to help our OEM customers reduce their manufacturing costs while maintaining or improving the design, quality, reliability, and delivery times for their products.\n\nWe expect that disruptions in our supply chain and fluctuations in the availability of parts and materials will continue to have an adverse impact on\n\nour ability to generate revenue, despite strong demand from our customers. Furthermore, in some cases, our efforts to identify and secure alternative supply chain sources have resulted in our customers or their end customers requiring requalification and validation of components, a process that can often be lengthy and has negatively impacted the timing of our revenue. In addition, we expect the near-term inventory correction that our optical communications customers are experiencing to persist, which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue.\n\nRevenues by Geography\n\nWe generate revenues from three geographic regions: North America, Asia-Pacific and others, and Europe. Revenues are attributed to a particular\n\ngeographic area based on the bill-to location of our customers, notwithstanding that the products may be shipped to a different geographic region. The substantial majority of our revenues are derived from our manufacturing facilities in Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America increased from 52.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 62.8% in the three months ended March 29, 2024, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in Israel and a decrease in sales to our customers in North America.\n\nThe percentage of our revenues generated from a bill-to location outside of North America increased from 50.3% in the nine months ended\n\nMarch 31, 2023 to 63.7% in the nine months ended March 29, 2024, primarily because of an increase in revenue from a customer in Israel and a decrease in sales to our customers in North America.\n\n31\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBased on the short and medium-term indications and forecasts from our customers, we expect that the portion of our future revenues attributable to\n\ncustomers in regions outside North America for the remainder of fiscal year 2024 will be in line with the portion of revenues attributable to such customers during the nine months ended March 29, 2024.\n\nThe following table presents percentages of total revenues by geographic region:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\nNine Months Ended\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nMarch 31,",

        "ground_truth": "Interest rate changes affect investment portfolios as the fair market values of fixed-rate securities decline if interest rates rise, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Exchange rate changes affect foreign operations as they impact gross profit margins, operating results, profitability, and cash flows when the dollar depreciates relative to foreign currencies like the Thai baht, GBP, or RMB. These changes also affect the reported results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities on consolidated balance sheets.",
        "contexts": [
            " securities decline if interest rates rise, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may be less than we expect because of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nAs a result of our foreign operations, we have significant expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. Substantially all\n\nof our employees and most of our facilities are located in Thailand, the PRC and the United Kingdom. Therefore, a substantial portion of our payroll as well as certain other operating expenses are paid in Thai baht, RMB and GBP. The significant majority of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars because our customer contracts generally provide that our customers will pay us in U.S. dollars.\n\nAs a consequence, our gross profit margins, operating results, profitability and cash flows are adversely impacted when the dollar depreciates relative to the Thai baht, the GBP or the RMB. We have a particularly significant currency rate exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the Thai baht, the GBP, the RMB and the U.S. dollar. We must translate foreign currency-denominated results of operations, assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars in our consolidated\n\n47\n\nTable of Contents\n\nfinancial statements. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared with such foreign currencies will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency. These transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nWe attempt to hedge against these exchange rate risks by entering into derivative instruments that are typically one to twelve months in duration,\n\nleaving us exposed to longer term changes in exchange rates. We designated the foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions denominated in Thai baht as cash flow hedges, as they qualified for hedge accounting because the hedges are highly effective. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting, if hedges do not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in our earnings. From December 28, 2019, any gains or losses related to these outstanding foreign currency forward contracts will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets, with subsequent reclassification to the same statement of operations and comprehensive income line item as the earnings effect of hedge items when settled. We recorded unrealized gain of $0.4 million and unrealized loss $0.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 and June 24, 2022, respectively, related to derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate relative to the U.S. dollar, we expect to incur foreign currency translation adjustments and may incur foreign currency exchange losses. For example, a 10% weakening in the U.S. dollar against the Thai baht, the RMB and the GBP would have resulted in a decrease in our net dollar position of approximately $6.0 million and $5.3 million as of June 30, 2023 and June 24, 2022, respectively. We cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on our consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nCredit risk refers to our exposures to financial institutions, suppliers and customers that have in the past and may in the future experience financial difficulty, particularly in light of recent conditions in the credit markets and the global economy. As of June 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were held in deposits and highly liquid investment products with maturities of three months or less with banks and other financial institutions having credit ratings of A minus or above. Our short-term investments as of June 30, 2023 are held in various financial institutions with a maturity limit not to exceed three years, and all securities are rated A1, P-1, F1 or better. We continue to monitor our surplus cash and consider investment in corporate and U.S. government debt as well as certain available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in accordance with our investment policy. We generally monitor the financial performance of our suppliers and customers, as well as other factors that may affect their access to capital and liquidity. Presently, we believe that we will not incur material losses due to our exposures to such credit risk.\n\n48\n\nTable of Contents\n\nITEM 8",
            " in a variety of financial instruments, including, but not limited to, U.S. government and agency bonds, corporate obligations, money market funds, asset-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities. The majority of these investments pay a fixed rate of interest. The securities in the investment portfolio are subject to market price risk due to changes in interest rates, perceived issuer creditworthiness, marketability, and other factors. These investments are generally classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nInvestments in both fixed-rate and floating-rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market values of our fixed-\n\nrate securities decline if interest rates rise, while floating-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may be less than we expect because of changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nAs a result of our foreign operations, we have significant expenses, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies.

Under the Implementation Rules, PRC citizens who are granted share options by an overseas publicly-listed company are required, through a PRC agent or PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company, to register with SAFE and complete certain other procedures.\n\n31\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, the General Administration of Taxation has issued circulars concerning employee share options. Under these circulars, our employees\n\nworking in the PRC who exercise share options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has obligations to file documents related to employee share options with relevant tax authorities and withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options.\n\nFurthermore, our transfer of funds to our subsidiaries in Thailand and the PRC are each subject to approval by governmental authorities in case of an\n\nincrease in registered capital, or subject to registration with governmental authorities in case of a shareholder loan. These limitations on the flow of funds between our subsidiaries and us could restrict our ability to act in response to changing market conditions.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nOur effective tax rate is a function of the mix of tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. We are domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to tax in the Cayman Islands on income or capital gains until March 6, 2039.\n\nThroughout the period of our operations in Thailand, we have generally received income tax and other incentives from the Thailand Board of\n\nInvestment. Preferential tax treatment from the Thai government in the form of a corporate tax exemption on income generated from projects to manufacture certain products at our Chonburi campus is currently available to us through June 2026. Similar preferential tax treatment was available to us through June 2020 with respect to products manufactured at our Pinehurst campus Building 6. After June 2020, 50% of our income generated from products manufactured at our Pinehurst campus will be exempted from tax through June 2025. Preferential tax treatment is available to us for products manufactured at our Chonburi campus Building 9, where income generated will be tax exempt through 2031, capped at our actual investment amount. Such preferential tax treatment is contingent on various factors, including the export of our customers\u2019 products out of Thailand and our agreement not to move our manufacturing facilities out of our current province in Thailand for at least 15 years from the date on which preferential tax treatment was granted. Currently, the corporate income tax rate for our Thai subsidiary is 20%.\n\nAs of December 27, 2024, the corporate income tax rates for our subsidiaries in the PRC, the U.S., the U.K. and Israel are 25%, 21%, 25% and 23%,\n\nrespectively.\n\nOur deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that\n\nwill result in deductible and payable amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards. Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change depending on future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws, or other factors. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\nWe prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and\n\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as their application places the most significant demands on our management\u2019s judgment.\n\nOur critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2024. The adoption of new accounting policies and accounting standards are disclosed in Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. There were no changes to our"

The Company expects to finalize the amendment to the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement during the three months ending December 27, 2024.\n\nAs of September 27, 2024, there was no amount outstanding under the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement.\n\nUnder the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of less than or equal to 1.5 times for Fabrinet Thailand and 1.0 times for the Parent Company.\n\nAs of September 27, 2024, the Borrowers were in compliance with all of their financial covenants under the 2023 Credit Facility Agreement.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLitigation and claim\n\nOn June 28, 2024, Ngan In Leng and First Laser Limited (collectively, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed a complaint in the Fuzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) in Fuzhou, China against Fujian Enterprises (Holdings) Co., Ltd.

The complaint alleges unjust enrichment related to a purported investment in Casix by the Plaintiffs in 1997, which predates the Company's acquisition of Casix from JDS Uniphase Corporation. The Plaintiffs have requested that the Court order FEHC to return the unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs in the amount of RMB 400 million, with interest from March 1, 2000, and order Jian and Casix to bear joint and several liability for all payment obligations of FEHC.\n\nIn September 2024, the Court dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety based on jurisdictional grounds. The Plaintiffs have since appealed the Court's ruling to the High People's Court of Fujian Province (the \"Appellate Court\"). In their appeal, the Plaintiffs now claim that Casix is the primary obligor to return the alleged unjust enrichment to the Plaintiffs. The matter is currently pending before the Appellate Court.

Although there are no minimum purchase requirements in our supply agreements, our customers provide us with rolling forecasts of their demand requirements. Our supply agreements generally include provisions for pricing and periodic review of pricing, consignment of our customer\u2019s unique production equipment to us, and the sharing of benefits from cost-savings derived from our efforts. We are generally required to purchase materials, which may include long lead-time materials and materials that are subject to minimum order quantities and/or non-cancelable or non-returnable terms, to meet the stated demands of our customers. After procuring materials, we manufacture products for our customers based on purchase orders that contain terms regarding product quantities, delivery locations and delivery dates. Our customers generally are obligated to purchase finished goods that we have manufactured according to their demand requirements. Materials that are not consumed by our customers within a specified period of time, or that are no longer required due to a product\u2019s cancellation or end-of-life, are typically designated as excess or obsolete inventory under our contracts. Once materials are designated as either excess or obsolete inventory, our customers are typically required to purchase such inventory from us even if they have chosen to cancel production of the related products. The excess or obsolete inventory is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized upon shipment.\n\nCost of Revenues\n\nThe key components of our cost of revenues are material costs, employee costs, and infrastructure-related costs. Material costs generally represent the majority of our cost of revenues. Several of the materials we require to manufacture products for our customers are customized for their products and often sourced from a single supplier or in some cases, our own subsidiaries. Shortages from sole-source suppliers due to yield loss, quality concerns and capacity constraints, among other factors, may increase our expenses and negatively impact our gross profit margin or total revenues in a given quarter. Material costs include scrap material. Historically, scrap rate diminishes during a product\u2019s life cycle due to process, fixturing and test improvement and optimization.\n\nA second significant element of our cost of revenues is employee costs, including indirect employee costs related to design, configuration and optimization of manufacturing processes for our customers, quality testing, materials testing and other engineering services, and direct costs related to our manufacturing employees. Direct employee costs include employee salaries, insurance and benefits, merit-based bonuses, recruitment, training and retention. Historically, our employee costs have increased primarily due to increases in the number of employees necessary to support our growth and, to a lesser extent, costs to recruit, train and retain employees. Our cost of revenues is significantly impacted by salary levels in Thailand, the PRC and the United Kingdom, the fluctuation of the Thai baht, Chinese Renminbi (\"RMB\") and pound sterling (\"GBP\") against our functional currency, the U.S. dollar, and our ability to retain our employees. We expect our employee costs to increase as wages continue to increase in Thailand and the PRC. Wage increases may impact our ability to sustain our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin. We seek to mitigate these cost increases through improvements in employee productivity, employee retention and asset utilization.\n\nOur infrastructure costs are comprised of depreciation, utilities, facilities management and overhead costs. Most of our facility leases are long-term\n\nagreements.

            " changes in fair value through contract maturity to foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income as a natural hedge against the Thai baht denominated assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency forward and option contracts to provide an offset to the re-measurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and to hedge certain forecasted exposures. Changes in the fair value of these non-designated derivatives are recorded as foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nAs of March 29, 2024, the Company had 135 outstanding U.S. dollar foreign currency forward contracts against Thai baht, with an aggregate notional amount of $135.0 million and maturity dates ranging from April 2024 through October 2024 and one outstanding Canadian dollar foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of 0.2 million Canadian dollars and a maturity date in June 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had 143 outstanding U.S. dollar foreign currency forward contracts against Thai baht with an aggregate notional amount of $143.0 million and maturity dates ranging from July 2023 through January 2024, and one outstanding Canadian dollar foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of 0.2 million Canadian dollars and a maturity date in September 2023.\n\nAs of March 29, 2024, the hedging relationship over foreign currency forward contracts designated for hedge accounting was determined to be highly effective based on the performance of retrospective and prospective regression testing. As of March 29, 2024, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months was a loss of $2.9 million.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the hedging relationship over foreign currency forward contracts designated for hedge accounting had been tested to be highly effective based on the performance of retrospective and prospective regression testing. As of June 30, 2023, the amount in AOCI expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months was a loss of $4.0 million.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended March 29, 2024, the Company included an unrealized loss of $3.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, from changes in the fair value of a foreign currency forward contract that was not designated for hedge accounting in earnings as foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nDuring the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, the Company included an unrealized loss of $2.1 million and an unrealized gain of $1.8 million, respectively, from changes in the fair value of a foreign currency forward contract that was\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nnot designated for hedge accounting in earnings as foreign exchange gain (loss), net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\n\nThe Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate risk and improve the interest rate profile of the Company\u2019s debt obligations. As of March 29, 2024 and June 30, 2023, the Company had one outstanding interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $60.9 million.\n\nOn July 25, 2018, Fabrinet Thailand entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert the floating interest rate of the term loan under the Company's previous syndicated senior credit facility agreement to a fixed interest rate of 2.86% per annum through the scheduled maturity of the term loan in June 2023 (see Note 10). The Company did not designate this interest rate swap for hedge accounting.\n\nOn September 3, 2019, Fabrinet Thailand entered into a term loan agreement under a credit facility agreement with Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited, and on September 10, 2019, the Company repaid in full the outstanding term loan under the Company's previous syndicated senior credit facility agreement (see Note 10). In conjunction with the funding of the new term loan, the Company entered into a second interest rate swap agreement. The combination of both of these interest rate swaps effectively converts the floating interest rate of the Company\u2019s term loan with Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited to a fixed interest rate of 4.36% per annum through the maturity of the term loan in June 2024.\n\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company designated these two interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge for the Company\u2019s term loan under the credit facility agreement with Bank of Ayudhya Public Company Limited. The combination of these two interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting because the hedges were highly effective, and the Company had designated and documented contemporaneously the hedging relationships involving these interest rate swaps, one of which matured in June 2023. While the Company intends to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting,"
