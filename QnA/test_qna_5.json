The Respondent was unable to commence work as the drawings were delayed and provided in a piecemeal manner. This prevented the preparation of coordinated Structural Shop Drawings, as a coordinated set of Architectural and Structural GFC drawings were required. The delay also caused the design development and shop drawing preparation activities to be postponed, as these activities could not commence without the necessary drawings. Additionally, the issuance of drawings was replete with inaccuracies and discrepancies, and the GFCs were substantially revised on various occasions, causing further delays.

EVENT 01: DELAY IN ISSUE OF ARCHITECTURAL GFC\n\nDRAWING FOR SUB STRUCTURE WORKS\n\n(i)\n\nIn accordance with the Contract (Sub clause 5.2 of the General\n\nConditions of the Contract), the complete responsibility for\n\nadequacy of Drawings and decisions thereof is of the Architect\n\nand/or Consultant alone and a coordinated set of Architectural\n\nand Structural drawings from Architect and/or Consultant were\n\nrequired as prerequisite for development of Substructure Shop\n\nDrawings.\n\n(ii) It\n\nis\n\nsubmitted\n\nthat\n\nunder\n\nContract,\n\nthe\n\nClaimant/Engineer/Claimant\u2019s\n\nConsultants were\n\nunder\n\nobligation to provide good for construction [GFC] drawing and\n\n295\n\nlikes to make available the same in accordance with the dates set\n\nout in the Respondent\u2019s Programme.\n\n(iii) It is submitted that as per the Contract, the Work was required to\n\ncommence only after receipt of the final GFC drawing from the\n\nEngineer and/or Claimant. However, not only the drawing was\n\ndelayed but were also provided in piecemeal manner.\n\n(iv) For the Respondent to develop Substructure Shop Drawings, a\n\ncoordinated set of Architectural and Structural Good\n\nConstruction [GFC] drawings were required from Claimant.\n\nWithout Architectural and Structural GFC drawings, design\n\ndevelopment and shop drawing preparation activities cannot\n\ncommence. Further, after receiving Architectural and Structural\n\ndrawings from Engineer, the Design Development Process requires\n\nminimum 2 months to complete.\n\n(v) The Hafees Contractor [Project Architect] was appointed, inter alia,\n\nfor Architectural Designs, and CBM was appointed, inter alia, for\n\nStructural Designs by the Claimant.\n\n(vi) The issuance of piece-meal and delayed Architectural GFC\n\ndrawings on part of the Engineer, prevented the Respondent from\n\npreparing coordinated Structural Shop Drawings. The drawing\n\n296\n\nfor\n\nissued by the Engineer from time to time were also replete with\n\ninaccuracies and discrepancies.\n\n(vii) The GFCs were also substantially revised on various occasions by\n\nthe Engineer and/or the Claimant causing further delay. Apart\n\nfrom above, Engineer also delayed review and approval of\n\nSubstructure Shop Drawings. There was major\n\nlack of\n\ncoordination between the Project Architect and the Claimant\u2019s\n\nStructure Designer, further prevented the Respondent from\n\nperforming its Scope of Works in timely manner but also disrupted\n\nthe planned progress and sequence of Works.\n\n(viii) The design coordination activities as well"

            " submitted that on 26.02.2020, the Engineer issued\n\nmisconceived letter containing a list of allegedly missing master\n\nkeys and cylinders and directing Respondent to replace them.\n\nImmediately,\n\nthe Respondent responded on 02.03.2020,\n\ninforming that all keys had been handed over to the Engineer a\n\nyear before with transmittals and had been checked and accepted\n\nby the Engineer before handover. Accordingly, any missing keys\n\nwere not Respondent\u2019s responsibility.\n\n445\n\n(xxiv) Throughout 2019, the Respondent progressively updated the\n\nClaimant/ Engineer on the de-snagging works and requested that\n\nthe Claimant\u2019s sign off on the handover of individual Apartments\n\nas they were complete. However, the Claimant/Engineer failed to\n\nprovide adequate supervision staff and prolonged the inspection\n\nand close out process. The result was that the Claimant/Engineer\n\nfailed to sign off on 47 of the 429 Apartments, keys for which were\n\nalready taken over by the Claimant on 31.08.2018.\n\n(xxv) It is submitted that again on 27.03.2020 and 31.03.2020,\n\nRespondent requested for issuance of Completion Certificate for\n\nthe whole of the Works. Vide letters dated 28.03.2020 and\n\n29.03.2020 the Engineer responded, inter alia, acknowledging the\n\nGovernments of India\u2019s and State Government\u2019s lockdown orders\n\nand appreciating the Respondent\u2019s efforts to comply with the\n\nsame. The Engineer however refused to grant the Completion\n\nCertificate as requested without stating or providing any details\n\nof Works that was required to be finished before issuing\n\nCompletion Certificate.\n\n(xxvi) At this stage, it is pertinent to mention that vide letter dated\n\n31.03.2020, the Respondent had categorically pointed out that\n\nalleged defects were not only minor snags but are being attended\n\n446\n\nby the Respondent under economic duress and without prejudice\n\nto stated position and so as not to give any grievance to the\n\nEngineer/Claimant that work was not being done as directed by\n\nthe Engineer/Claimant and for the sake of closure of the contract,\n\nalthough same was neither the obligation of the Respondent nor\n\nwere within the scope of work, as the Claimant had threatened to\n\ninvoke Bank Guarantees and was also withholding Completion\n\nCertificate\n\nillegally. Further,\n\nit was also\n\nintimated that\n\nClaimant/Engineer has forced the Respondent to attend to non-\n\ncontractual requests of the Claimant/Engineer, as Respondent\n\nhad provided a significant amount of performance and retention\n\nbank Guarantee(s) totaling \u20b9 222,06,00,291 to Claimant and\n\nClaimant was threatening the Respondent to encash the same, in\n\ncase Respondent does not comply to unreasonable requests of\n\nClaimant.\n\n(xxvii) On 07.04.2020, the Engineer issued a misconceived and\n\nfrivolous letter, inter alia, alleging that 129 works were not\n\ncomplete. The Claimant\u2019s intent to protract and delay the matter\n\nis evident from the fact that the said letter included the alleged\n\ndefects, which were already complete and were even\n\nacknowledged by the Engineer himself to be complete. Infact, 37\n\n447\n\nout of 129 alleged works listed were not even within the scope of\n\nthe Respondent (including some works descoped).\n\n(xxviii) Said misconceived letter dated 07.04.2020 was responded by\n\nthe Respondent on 04.05.2020. The Respondent categorically\n\nrefuted allegations relating to the defects pointed out by the\n\nEngineer along with supporting documents. The Respondent\n\nfurther pointed out that the letter dated 7.04.2020 is issued by\n\nthe Engineer at the instance of the Claimant with ulterior motive.\n\nThe Respondent inter alia clarified that the purported defects\n\nwere either already rectified and accepted by the Engineer or were\n\nrectified and awaiting inspection or had been raised for the first\n\ntime and were raised belatedly or were not within the\n\nRespondent\u2019s scope of work etc. as more particularly enumerated\n\nin the letter.\n\n(xxix)\n\nIn spite of the fact that Works was complete, Engineer failed\n\nto issue the Completion Certificate and the Respondent was\n\ndirectly or indirectly compelled to remain at Site by the Claimant\n\n"
