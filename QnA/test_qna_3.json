The Engineer on 1 September 2022115 in its communication challenged the Contractor\u2019s requirement, stating that no contractual provision was made for these openings. However, the Contractor refutes this claim, emphasizing that the method of execution was discussed during meetings, and provisions for openings were required and agreed upon in principle. Furthermore, the Contractor stresses that without these openings, the entire section between two openings cannot be partially handed over, which would delay key dates and impact the contractual schedule. But the Engineer\u2019s response is not in alignment with the outcomes of those discussions.\n\n259. On September 2022116, the Contractor requests either the provision of the necessary openings or that the Engineer issue variation orders, changing the Contract's stipulations on the number of openings, access conditions, and key dates. This would allow the Contractor to assess and submit time and cost impacts due to the Engineer\u2019s proposed changes.\n\n260. On 29 April 2024117, the Engineer acknowledges that delays in access dates have occurred and indicates that these will be dealt with as per the relevant provisions of the Contract.

The Contractor\u2019s inability to start underground works was directly caused by the lack of access to the designated section. As a result of the restricted access, the Contractor experienced significant delays in commencing underground construction activities. This had a cascading effect on the project timeline, leading to potential disruptions in project milestones and overall completion. Consequently, the Contractor assessed the impact of same in the following section. e) Defining Delay Duration\n\ni. Delay Fragnet\n\n262. The following is the list of delay fragnet considered in the delay analysis to assess the impact of\n\nthe subject event on the completion key dates:\n\n115 Engineer Letter No. AEON-IRCON-CO-C4-TRK-09-22-111 dated 01 September 2022 116 Contractor\u2019s Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC2/136 dated 10 September 2022 117 Engineer letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-04-24-937 dated 29 April 2024\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 88 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nDelay Event ID\n\nDelay Event Name\n\nDelay Start Delay End\n\nDelay Duration\n\nDE-03\n\nDE-03-01\n\nDE-03-01-A\n\nDE-03-01-B\n\nDE-03-01-C\n\nDE-03-02\n\nDE-03-02-A\n\nDE-03-02-B\n\nDelay in underground section Delay in access hand over from Light House to Thirumayilai Station Delay in access hand over from Tunnel stretch from Light House Station to Thirumayilai Station Delay in access hand over at Light House station Delay in access hand over at Light House - Crossover C001 Delay in access hand over from Boat Club Station to Panagal Park Station Delay in access hand over from Tunnel stretch from Boat Club to Panagal park Delay in access hand over at Panagal Park station Delay in access hand over at Panagal Park - Crossover C002\n\nproviding\n\naccess\n\nof\n\n22-Mar-24\n\n05-Jul-24*\n\n22-Mar-24*\n\n22-Mar-24*\n\n02-Jul-24\n\n02-Jul-24*\n\n02-Jul-24*\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n132\n\n27\n\n132\n\n132\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\nDE-03-02-C\n\n02-Jul-24*\n\n31-Jul-24\n\n30\n\n263. The delay starts after the shared access date for providing access of underground sections have lapsed and the delay continues till the cutoff date i.e., 31 July 2024 as some of the underground sections planned to be handed over by the track contractor in one continuous stretch and with no snag points have not been handed over yet to the Contractor. ii. Impacted activities and added relationships\n\n264. Annexure-13 shows the added relationship between the delay fragnet and the impacted activities in the programme. Reasonable lags have been taken for impacting the relevant activities considering the completion time of that particular activity.\n\niii. Impacted Critical Path\n\n265. This has extended the Project completion date to 05 January 2026 from 05 January 2026, hence a delay of 0 calendar days is evident. This entitles the Contractor to an Extension of Time by 0 calendar days.\n\n266. The longest critical path can be referred to in Annexure 14.\n\niv. Conclusion\n\n267.

Maintain a minimum pressure difference of 0.05-in.wg. (12.5-Pa) across the smoke barriers 2. Limit the maximum door opening force to 30-Ibs (133-N) for all doors (doors between smoke\n\nzones, doors into stairwells, doors to all rooms connected to the corridor within the fire/zone)\n\nPage 3 of 6\n\n2407 4744 E: info@amani\u00e9\n\nWi vow amanfec.com T: +968\n\n4l Muzn Mall, 3rd floor, Al Mawaleh North - aSeeb, Muscat, PD Bex 169, PC 101, Sultanate of Oman | CR-1313271 Oman | KSA | UAE\n\nThe simplified spreadsheet calculations that were submitted by the design Engineer are not industry standard and are not capable of accurately assessing the complex leakage paths, interacting smoke control systems, wind forces, outdoor temperature, stack effect, and other factors that will impact the performance of the smoke control system on this project. Using software such as CONTAM or other network models is industry standard for this level of complexity and this system type. The spreadsheet calculations submitted by the design Engineer do not account for major parameters, have flawed fundamental assumptions, and have unrealistic final results. Thus, the calculations are neither reliable\n\nnor accurate and cannot be used to justify the system.\n\nErrors in the Submitted Smoke Control Calculations from the Design Engineer\n\nA summary of the calculation flaws within ZONE 1, FIFTH FLOOR is listed below, the other zones have similar comments:\n\nThe submitted calculations do not account for wind pressure that will be present and affect pressure levels in the building \u2014 this is required to be considered in the calculations per NFPA 92.\n\nThe submitted calculations do not account for stack effect across the height of the building \u2014 this is required to be considered in the calculations per NFPA 92.\n\nThe submitted calculations do not account for ambient outdoor temperatures of the project location that will affect pressure levels in the building \u2014 this is required to be considered in the calculations per NFPA 92.\n\nThe submitted calculations have flawed fundamental assumptions such as:\n\n\u00a2 Incorrectly assumes that all airflow in a fire/smoke zone will only flow through the cracks of 3 total doors between the stairwells and adjacent fire/smoke zones (page 18 of 326). Does not account for the airflow that will escape the fire/smoke zone through the exterior walls, floor, roof, elevator shafts, interior smoke barrier walls, etc. - which are major factors required to be included in the calculations.\n\n\u00a2 Incorrectly assumes that 100% of the airflow quantity for the stairwell pressurization system will flow through the cracks of the single door within the fire/smoke zone. Does,\n\nnot account for the airflow that will escape the stairwell through the exterior walls, roof,\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\nW: www amanfe\n\nTs +568 2407 6743 E: info@amanfec.com\n\nOman | KSA | UAE\n\nAman\n\nEngineering\n\ndoors of all other levels that the stairwell serves, etc. - which are major factors required to be included in the calculations.\n\nThe submitted calculations show that the pressure will be 17,765.48 [Pa] within ZONE 1 when it is fire/smoke zone (page 18 of 326), which is not possible for a smoke control system or fan static pressure to produce and is well beyond a reasonable pressure estimate. The maximum allowable pressure is around 90 [Pa] per NFPA 92 (depending on the door characteristics) \u2014 so the submitted calculations are over 170 times (17,000%) greater than code-maximum pressure. Thus, this one example shows the errors in the calculations are to such an extent, that Aman is not able accept them as reliable calculations to justify the smoke control system.\n\nThe submitted calculation incorrectly calculates the opening force of the door between zones (page 19 of 326). The assumption that the pressure will be 18.4 [Pa] at the door contradicts the 17,765.48 [Pa] value calculated above. The pressure that the door between zones experiences will be the sum of the negative pressure in the fire zone and the positive pressure in the adjacent zone. However, there are no calculations submitted for the pressure in the adjacent zone. The submitted calculations only list the airflow in adjacent ZONE 2 is given, however the pressure, not just the airflow, in ZONE 2 is required to calculate door opening forces.\n\nThe submitted calculation incorrectly calculates the opening force of the stairwell door (page 19 of 326). The assumption that the pressure will be 42.3 [Pa] at the door contradicts the 17,765.48 [Pa",
            "] value calculated above. The pressure that the stairwell door experiences will be the sum of the negative pressure provided by the smoke control system and the positive Pressure created by the stairwell pressurization system. However, the calculations are incorrectly estimating the interaction of the stairwell pressurization system and smoke control system.\n\nThere are other flaws in the calculations, but those listed above are enough to show that the\n\nspread sheet calculations are not equipped to properly assess this smoke control system.\n\nPage 5o0f6\n\nWe waw.amanfec.com T; +968 2407 4744 E: info@amanfec.com Ai Muzn Mail, 3rd floor, Al Mawaieh North - 4\u2019Seeb.

The delays in providing access to these sections postponed the work and disrupted the Contractor's planned construction sequence, resulting in time and financial losses. Additionally, many of the sections handed over contained unresolved snag points or were occupied by other contractors, causing frequent disruptions, costly resource shifts, extended work schedules, and a significant negative impact on overall Project efficiency.",

The progress of track works has been significantly hindered due to the delayed handover of the elevated viaduct sections, as specified in the detailed work program. According to the Contract, key sections of the viaduct were to be handed over on particular dates, and the Contractor had planned its activities and construction sequence accordingly. However, the delays in providing access to these sections have not only postponed the work but also disrupted the Contractor\u2019s planned construction sequence, resulting in both time and financial losses. Additionally, many of the sections that were handed over contained unresolved snag points or remained occupied by other contractors. These delays have caused frequent disruptions, leading to costly resource shifts, extended work schedules, and a significant negative impact on overall Project efficiency. b) Contractual Entitlement\n\n215. Clause 8.4 (Extension of Time for Completion) of GCC states that:\n\nThe Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor\u2019s Claims] to an extension of the Time for Completion if and to the extent that completion for the purposes of Sub-Clause 10.1 [Taking Over of the Works and Sections] is or will be delayed by any of the following causes:\n\n(b) a cause of delay giving an entitlement to extension of time under a Sub-Clause of these Conditions,\n\n(e)any delay, impediment or prevention caused by or attributable to the Employer, the Employer's Personnel, or the Employer's other contractors\n\n216. Clause 2.1(Right of Access to the Site) of General condition of the Contract states that:\n\nThe Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the site within the time stated in the Contract Data.\n\nIf no such time is stated in the Contract data, the Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of the Site as per the programme submitted under Clause 8.3.\n\nFor the purpose of reckoning the delay, the latter among the dates mentioned in the Appendix- 2A and the date by which the Contractor required such track length in the approved programme shall be considered.\n\nFurther that the progress of works in the track length where access is given is to the satisfaction of the Employer, then the Contractor's entitlement towards such delays shall be as under:\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 71 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nc) Chronology of Events\n\n217.

The Contractor has failed to meet Project commitments, indicating inadequate planning and resource mobilization. As per Clause 8.6 of the GCC, the Contractor is required to provide an updated status, a detailed program, and an action plan within 7 days. Failure to address these deficiencies promptly will result in delay damages, and immediate corrective action is expected to ensure the timely completion of the track works.\n\n223. On 07 September 202399, the Contractor replied to the Engineer notice regarding delay damages, the Contractor highlighted that the delays in the Project are largely due to the failure of the\n\n97 Contractor\u2019s Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC 2/636 dated 28 June 2023 98 Engineer\u2019s letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-PRJ-08-23-701 dated 31 August 2023 99 Contractor Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK01-GC-2/730 dated 07 September 2023\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 75 of 116\n"

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate the Contractual basis of the Contractor's claim for an Extension of the Time for Completion and the consequential costs arising out of or in connection therewith.\n\n70.\n\nIt has been an underlying obligation of the Contractor to proceed with and carry out the Works with due care and diligence and as far as practicable within the stipulated Time for Completion for the whole of the Works.\n\n71. Concurrently, the Employer (by its duties under the Contract)46, had an underlying obligation not to unreasonably delay the Contract which would prevent the Contractor from fulfilling its obligations under the Contract.\n\n72.",
            " The Contract recognizes that the execution of the Works may be delayed, disrupted, or otherwise impeded due to extenuating reasons that were not foreseen at the time of entering the Contract and were wholly beyond the control and responsibility of the Contractor.\n\n4.2 THE EMPLOYER/ENGINEER\u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS\n\n73. The below schematics depict the overview of dependence of planned sequence of the Contractor\u2019s Works on various factors attributable to the Engineer/Employer that are beyond the Contractor\u2019s control; by illustrating how the key reasons of delays had or have been delaying (till cut-off date) the planned progress and sequence of works:\n\n46 Clause 1.9 Delayed Drawings or Instructions, Clause 2.1 Right of Access to the Site of GCC, Clause 2.2 Permits, License Approvals of GCC, Clause 2.3 Employer's Personnel of GCC, Clause 13.7 Adjustments for Changes in Legislation of GCC, Clause 13.8 Adjustments for Changes In 'Cost\u2019 of GCC\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 26 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nTable 6:The Employer/Engineer\u2019s Responsibilities and Obligations\n\n74. The following is evident from the above schematic diagram:\n\n\n\nthe level of dependency of the Contractor\u2019s planned sequence of work on the required inputs is throughout the execution.\n\n\n\nthat without these mandatory inputs, the associated stages of the Contractor\u2019s work cannot be completed, even in scenario where the Contractor commences the associated works prior to receipt of or finalization of these inputs under mitigating measure.\n\n75.

As per Part 2 Section VI of Employer\u2019s requirement, the Contractor had to submit the required Contract Baseline Schedule within 4 weeks47 under clause 5.1 after the Commencement Date of the Project.\n\n77. Subsequently, the Contractor submitted the initial work program on 28 March 202248, and after addressing various comments from the Engineer, the final version was submitted on 10 August 202249.\n\n78. After a series of compliances, on 22 August 202250, the Engineer/Employer accepted the initial work programme duly giving it the effect of Approved/Contract Baseline Schedule.\n\n79.

The progress of track works in the underground sections has been significantly hindered due to delays in the handover of these sections, as outlined in the Detailed Work Program. As per the contract, key underground sections were to be handed over on specific dates, and the Contractor had scheduled its activities and construction sequence accordingly. However, the delays in granting access to these areas have not only postponed the work but also disrupted the Contractor's planned sequence of operations, causing both time and financial losses. Furthermore, many of the sections that were eventually handed over contained unresolved snag points or were still occupied by other contractors. These delays in handover have caused frequent disruptions, leading to costly resource shifts, extended work schedules, and a considerable negative impact on overall Project efficiency. b) Contractual Entitlement\n\n253. Clause 8.4 (Extension of Time for Completion) of GCC states that:\n\nThe Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor\u2019s Claims] to an extension of the Time for Completion if and to the extent that completion for the purposes of Sub-Clause 10.1 [Taking Over of the Works and Sections] is or will be delayed by any of the following causes:\n\n(b) a cause of delay giving an entitlement to extension of time under a Sub-Clause of these Conditions,\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 85 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\n(e)any delay, impediment or prevention caused by or attributable to the Employer, the Employer's Personnel, or the Employer's other contractors\n\n254. Clause 2.1(Right of Access to the Site) of General condition of the Contract states that:\n\nThe Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the site within the time stated in the Contract Data.\n\nIf no such time is stated in the Contract data, the Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of the Site as per the programme submitted under Clause 8.3.\n\nFor the purpose of reckoning the delay, the latter among the dates mentioned in the Appendix- 2A and the date by which the Contractor required such track length in the approved programme shall be considered.\n\nFurther that the progress of works in the track length where access is given is to the satisfaction of the Employer, then the Contractor's entitlement towards such delays shall be as under:\n\nc) Chronology",

            "\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nEngineer/Employer to meet key access dates as outlined in the Contract Agreement. The Contractor clarified that despite mobilizing resources as per the schedule, several key areas were not handed over on time, resulting in demobilization of resources and financial loss. Additionally, some of the partially handed over sections have been damaged by the civil contractor, who has been allowed to use these areas for vehicle movement, further delaying progress.\n\n224. On 12 October 2023100, the Engineer informed the Contractor that the Contractor chief interface manager rejected the handover statement from the civil contractor after a joint survey between P no. 329 to 352 due to snag points. However, the Engineer\u2019s review found the levels acceptable, and the snag points will not affect rail lifting, welding, or track works. The Engineer advised to withdraw the rejection and address the snag points based on priority, following the Contract's Interface Management guidelines.\n\n225. The Contractor on 19 October 2023101, intimated that with regard to the taking over of the viaduct section from P329 to P352, the same section is filled with snag points and hence intimated the Employer that, the shear connectors spacing and height are not matching as per drawing, If any failure on account of above, the Contractor is not responsible, and the additional work incurred like surface levelling of deck slab, shear connectors cutting, chipping, straightening of shear connectors, repairing of cracks in U-girder etc., will be worked out and this estimate will be submitted to the Employer for payment purpose.\n\n226. On 06 Nov 2023102, the Engineer acknowledged that only 1,527 track meters were handed over on both up and down lines, and even this was in three separate locations on staggered dates under ISF No. 008/KEC (04 February 2023) and ISF No. 009 (30 September 2023). This phased handover caused disruptions to the Track Contractor\u2019s ability to plan and execute work efficiently. The letter confirms that the handover was provided under shared access conditions, which inherently limited the contractor\u2019s ability to work freely and progress at an optimal pace. Shared access often leads to interruptions and additional coordination challenges, which are beyond the Track Contractor\u2019s control.\n\n227. Despite the Project schedule, the significant delay in handing over sections\u2014spanning from February 2023 to September 2023\u2014indicates the Employer\u2019s inability to ensure that the Civil Contractor met its obligations. This delay disrupted the Track Contractor\u2019s ability to adhere to the planned timelines for track work.\n\n228. The Contractor on 1 February 2024103, intimated the Employer that a grouting issue was identified for bearings at viaduct segments P309-P310. Even though the section was handed over for track work on 02 September 2023 after clearing snag points, there were pending grouting works. These balance works should have been completed before handover, as stopping track works in the midst\n\n100 Engineer\u2019s letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-INT-10-23-735 dated 12 October 2023 101 Contractor Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC-2/781 dated 19 October 2023 102 Engineer letter No.: AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-11-23-763 dated 06 Nov 2023 103 Contractor Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC-2/921 dated 01 February 2024\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 76 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nof progress shall be unacceptable. In addition, this oversight could lead to incorrect track parameters.\n\n229. The Engineer on 05 February 2024104, the Engineer raised concerns over the Contractor's slow progress, lack of adequate response, and failure to meet deadlines, warning that continued delays will be treated as attributable solely to the Contractor, and corrective action is urgently required to avoid further escalation, including potential initiation of actions under GCC Cl. 15.1.\n\n230. The Engineer on 05 February 2024105, alleged that despite being handed over the viaduct on 2 September 2023, the track contractor made little progress on track laying and only recently began rail loading and welding after repeated follow-ups, failure to progress could result in penalties under GCC 8.7 and PCC 52 for delay damages.\n\n231. The handover of the viaduct segment at P309-P310 on 2nd September 2023 was not conducive to immediate progress.",
            " Critical works such as grouting of bearings and the issuance of ICCF-10 by the Civil Contractor were completed only on 1st February 2024, causing over five months of delay for the Track Contractor to proceed with plinth casting\n\n232. On 25 March 2024106, the Engineer issued a formal communication to the Contractor highlighting significant concerns over delays in achieving key dates of elevated structure and test track with substantial completion of work. The Engineer emphasized that the Contractor\u2019s inability to meet these milestones violates the requirements outlined in the Contract and exposes them to delay damages as per the applicable clauses, including GCC and PCC provisions. The communication concluded with a reminder that further non-compliance could invoke contractual penalties, stressing the need for urgent corrective measures.\n\n233. On 26 March 2024107, the Engineer issued the Contractor the notice for the shortfall in the works of elevated section.\n\n234. On 10 April 2024108, the Contractor notified the Employer about unresolved issues, including the closure of snag points and the failure to remove shuttering and other construction materials from the handed-over site, which caused disruptions to the planned works.\n\n235. On 18 April 2024109, the Contractor notified the Employer that the availability of work fronts on the viaduct section did not align with the agreed contractual terms. The viaduct sections were handed over to the Contractor in fragmented portions, disrupting the continuity of work.\n\n104 Engineer\u2019s letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-02-24-839 dated 05 February 2024 105 Engineer\u2019s letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-ECV02-CON-02-24-2063 dated 05 February 2024 106 Engineer letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-03-24-889 dated 25 March 2024 107 Engineer letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-03-24-892 dated 26 March 2024 108 Contractor Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC-2/1052 dated 10 April 2024 109 Contractor\u2019s Letter no.

On 29 April 2024110, the Engineer acknowledged that delays in access dates have occurred and indicates that these will be dealt with as per the relevant provisions of the contract. This implicitly validates the Contractor's concerns about delayed handover affecting their performance. The letter specifically mentions that a 6 km stretch from Porur Bypass was handed over in a phased manner starting February 2023. This phased approach has likely disrupted the Contractor\u2019s planning and execution.\n\n237. The Engineer points out that plinth concreting began only in February 2024, despite the handover starting in February 2023. This delay indirectly highlights that the conditions or access provided to the Contractor may not have been conducive for timely commencement of work.\n\n238. On 19 July 2024111, the Contractor notified the Employer of a primary breach of Contract due to the failure to meet the agreed key dates for the handover of civil works, which are critical for the progress of track work. As per the contract, 51.673 km of the section (10.526 km in the Depot and 41.147 km in the Elevated Corridor) was to be handed over. However, only 9.42 km of the Elevated Corridor and 7.0 km of the Depot have been handed over, and even then, with shared access, numerous snag points, and in a piecemeal manner. Of the 9.42 km handed over, only 1.95 km was suitable for plinth casting, with the rest hindered by unresolved snag points. Critically, no section has been provided with hindrance-free access, severely impacting the progress of the works and contributing to delays beyond our control.

The progress of track works in the underground sections has been significantly hindered due to delays in the handover of these sections, as outlined in the Detailed Work Program. As per the contract, key underground sections were to be handed over on specific dates, and the Contractor had scheduled its activities and construction sequence accordingly. However, the delays in granting access to these areas have not only postponed the work but also disrupted the Contractor's planned sequence of operations, causing both time and financial losses. Furthermore, many of the sections that were eventually handed over contained unresolved snag points or were still occupied by other contractors. These delays in handover have caused frequent disruptions, leading to costly resource shifts, extended work schedules, and a considerable negative impact on overall Project efficiency. b) Contractual Entitlement\n\n253. Clause 8.4 (Extension of Time for Completion) of GCC states that:\n\nThe Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor\u2019s Claims] to an extension of the Time for Completion if and to the extent that completion for the purposes of Sub-Clause 10.1 [Taking Over of the Works and Sections] is or will be delayed by any of the following causes:\n\n(b) a cause of delay giving an entitlement to extension of time under a Sub-Clause of these Conditions,\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 85 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\n(e)any delay, impediment or prevention caused by or attributable to the Employer, the Employer's Personnel, or the Employer's other contractors\n\n254. Clause 2.1(Right of Access to the Site) of General condition of the Contract states that:\n\nThe Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the site within the time stated in the Contract Data.\n\nIf no such time is stated in the Contract data, the Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of the Site as per the programme submitted under Clause 8.3.\n\nFor the purpose of reckoning the delay, the latter among the dates mentioned in the Appendix- 2A and the date by which the Contractor required such track length in the approved programme shall be considered.\n\nFurther that the progress of works in the track length where access is given is to the satisfaction of the Employer, then the Contractor's entitlement towards such delays shall be as under:\n\nc) Chronology",
            " of Events\n\n255. As per the Detailed Work Programme submitted on 07 September 2023113, the Employer had to start handover of the underground section by 10 January 2022.\n\n256. As per the Contract Agreement para 2, Section 6, Employer\u2019s requirement Annexure 4, page 223-\n\n226, the handover dates for the depot area are as follows:\n\n113 Contractor\u2019s letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC-2/734 dated 07 September 2023\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 86 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\n257.

The Engineer on 1 September 2022115 in its communication challenged the Contractor\u2019s requirement, stating that no contractual provision was made for these openings. However, the Contractor refutes this claim, emphasizing that the method of execution was discussed during meetings, and provisions for openings were required and agreed upon in principle. Furthermore, the Contractor stresses that without these openings, the entire section between two openings cannot be partially handed over, which would delay key dates and impact the contractual schedule. But the Engineer\u2019s response is not in alignment with the outcomes of those discussions.\n\n259. On September 2022116, the Contractor requests either the provision of the necessary openings or that the Engineer issue variation orders, changing the Contract's stipulations on the number of openings, access conditions, and key dates. This would allow the Contractor to assess and submit time and cost impacts due to the Engineer\u2019s proposed changes.\n\n260. On 29 April 2024117, the Engineer acknowledges that delays in access dates have occurred and indicates that these will be dealt with as per the relevant provisions of the Contract.

            ". This Report is submitted in connection with the Contractor\u2019s request for an extension of time (EOT) for the completion of the \u201cSupply, Installation, Testing, and Commissioning of Track Works\u201d for the Chennai Metro Rail Project, Corridor 4 (C4 - TRK \u2013 01). The Contractor, is responsible for executing the Project between Lighthouse Station and Poonamallee Bypass Station, including the Poonamallee Depot. The primary objective of this Report is to demonstrate the Contractor\u2019s entitlement to the EOT based on the delays experienced up to the cut-off date of 31 July 2024.\n\n26. The total length of the Project involves approximately 28.62 Route Kilometers, including both elevated and underground sections. The Project, valued at INR 337.76 crores, commenced on 14 February 2022, with a planned completion date of 05 January 2026. However, several delays have significantly impacted progress, necessitating this request for an extension.\n\n27. The Contractor has encountered numerous delay events, primarily stemming from factors beyond its control, which have severely impacted the planned schedule. The main delay events considered in this analysis are summarized as follows and detailed in Part 6 of the Report:\n\nDelay Event No. DE-01 DE-01-01 DE-01-02 DE-01-03 DE-01-04\n\nDE-02\n\nDE-03 DE-04 DE-04-01 DE-04-02 DE-04-03\n\nDescription\n\nDelay in providing access of depot area Delay in providing access of test track and open area in depot Delay in providing access of Inspection Bay Line Delay in providing access of Repair Bay Line Delay in providing access of Stabling Bay Line Delay in tracks works due to piecemeal and partial hand over of elevated viaduct Delay in providing access of underground section Delay due to variation works/additional works Delay due to galvanization of ERC Clip Delay due to change in design of Column Track Delay due to tilting of rail panels while painting\n\nTable 2: Summary of key delay events\n\n28. Delay in providing access to the depot area19: The Contractor faced significant delays in accessing critical areas within the depot, including the test track, open area, stabling bay lines, inspection bay lines, and repair bay lines. The piecemeal and unorganized handover of these sections resulted in the Project disruptions and delayed activities. Despite multiple notifications,\n\n19 Part 6, 6.2.1 of this report\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 13 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nfull access to these areas was not provided in a timely manner, impacting the planned execution sequence.\n\n29. Delay in track works due to piecemeal & partial handover of elevated viaduct20: Delays in the handover of the elevated viaduct sections resulted in prolonged interruptions in the track works. The Contractor was unable to carry out continuous work due to the incomplete access provided by the civil contractors.\n\n30. Delay in providing access to the underground section21: Similar to the depot area, the Contractor experienced delays in accessing critical portions of the underground section, causing further disruptions to the construction timeline.\n\n31. Delays due to variation/additional works22: Various variations and additional works requested by the Employer introduced further delays in the execution process. The Contractor has documented these changes and their impact on the overall timeline.\n\n32. However, it is an undisputed position that the Project has been suffering inordinate delays since its inception due to various reasons not attributable to the Contractor. The Project has been critically affected by some major delays including but not limited to delay in providing access, delay due to variation/additional works etc.\n\n33. The Contractor through various letters, e-mail correspondences, MOMs and monthly progress reports, has consistently been raising the issues which are critical to the Project and hampering the Project progress. The Contractor is therefore of the opinion that it is entitled for an Extension of Time for Completion, for the delays which are not attributable to it and were not envisaged at the time of bidding.\n\n34. This Report covers a detailed analysis of those delay events which are beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and affected the Project progress during the course of the Project i.e., from the date of Commencement 14 February 2022 till 31 July 2024 (the cut-off date for this Report). This Report serves as an interim request and entitles the Contractor for an Extension of Time for Completion without levying any Liquidated Damages.\n\n35. The Contractor has employed the Impacted As Planned (IAP) methodology to conduct a detailed delay analysis in line with industry standards and best practices. This methodology has been utilized",
            " to identify and evaluate the delay events that have significantly impacted the progress of the Project.\n\n36. As part of this analysis, the Contractor has incorporated the relevant delay fragnets into the baseline schedule to assess the extent of the delays. These delay events have been determined to\n\n20 Part 6, 6.2.2 of this report 21 Part 6, 6.2.3 of this report 22 Part 6, 6.2.4 of this report\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 14 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nbe outside the Contractor's reasonable control and are not attributable to any actions or omissions on the Contractor's part.\n\n37. The Contractor remains committed to fulfilling its contractual obligations and has made all reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of these delay events. This submission, supported by the IAP methodology, forms the basis for the Contractor's request for an Extension of Time (EOT) in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Contract. The detailed explanation of the delay analysis methodology has been explained in Part-5 of this report. It is to note that, each delay event is inserted in the detailed work programme to assess the individual impact of each delay event over the previous events.\n\n\n\nIf a shift is noted in the scheduled completion date of the Project Milestones after insertion and the impact of a particular delay event, the delay impact is considered to be critical. The additional impact the delay events make may be noted and then the procedure is repeated for the next delay event.\n\n39. However, if no shift is noted, the delay impact is considered to be non-critical. Again, the\n\nprocedure is repeated for the next delay event.\n\n40. The Contractor is of the opinion that it is entitled to an additional cost for the prolonged period and other losses which are not attributable to the Contractor and were not envisaged at the time of bidding.\n\n41.\n\nIt is to be noted that various delays and disruption events in the Works resulted/ resulting in losses and non-recovery of cost expenses being incurred to the Contractor.\n\n42. The cumulative effect of these delays has led to significant disruptions in the planned execution of the Project. As of 31 July 2024, the physical progress achieved stands at 41.19%23, while the financial progress is recorded at 24.55%24. These delays have impacted the Project\u2019s critical path, extending the Project completion date by 650 days, which is reflected in this submission.\n\n43. The Contractor has adhered to the contractual provisions under the General Conditions of Contract (GCC), including clauses related to delayed access (Clause 2.1) and extension of time (Clause 8.4). Despite the Contractor's efforts to mitigate delays and proceed with the available work, the lack of timely access and other disruptions has affected the Project\u2019s schedule. The Contractor is, therefore, entitled to an extension of time of 650 days, along with compensation for the additional costs incurred due to these delays.\n\n44. This Report covers a detailed analysis of those delay events which are beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and affected the Project progress during the course of the Project i.e., from the date of Commencement 14 February 2022 till 31 July 2024 (the cut-off date for this\n\n23 Contractor\u2019s MPR for July 2024, doc ref no.

The above summarized contract Clauses & detailed chronology of events confirm that under the Contract Contractor is entitled to Extension of Time of 335 days on account of Sub-Clause 2.1 (Right of access to Site), Sub-Clause 8.4 (b) for Extension of time.\n\n6.2.1.4 DE-01-04: DELAY IN PROVIDING ACCESS OF STABLING BAY LINE\n\na) Introduction\n\n192. The Contractor experienced substantial delays in gaining access to the Stabling Bay Lines (SBL) due to non-sequential and partial handovers by the civil contractor. These disruptions significantly impacted the planned execution of track works, particularly in the depot area, where access to critical sections was delayed. The detailed work plan, submitted on 07 September 2023, anticipated the full handover of the stabling bay lines by 26 March 2023, allowing for efficient and continuous work. However, this timeline was not adhered to, with the final handover of key sections occurring as late as July 2024.\n\n193. The delayed access to the SBL areas, coupled with the incomplete civil works, hindered the Contractor\u2019s ability to proceed according to the planned sequence of activities. As a result, rail welding and other critical works were delayed, leading to increased costs, operational inefficiencies, and significant disruptions to the Project\u2019s overall timeline. Despite efforts to mitigate these issues, the Contractor faced substantial challenges in meeting the Project deadlines, as the sequence of construction had to be frequently altered due to the late handover of various SBL sections. b) Contractual Entitlement\n\n194. Clause 2.1(Right of Access to the Site) of General condition of the Contract states that:\n\nThe Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of, all parts of the site within the time stated in the Contract Data.\n\nIf no such time is stated in the Contract data, the Employer shall give the Contractor right of access to, and possession of the Site as per the programme submitted under Clause 8.3.\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 63 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nFor the purpose of reckoning the delay, the latter among the dates mentioned in the Appendix- 2A and the date by which the Contractor required such track length in the approved programme shall be considered.\n\nFurther that the progress of works in the track length where access is given is to the satisfaction of the Employer, then the Contractor's entitlement towards such delays shall be as under:\n\n195. Clause 8.4 (Extension of Time for Completion) of GCC states that:\n\nThe Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor\u2019s Claims] to an extension of the Time for Completion if and to the extent that completion for the purposes of Sub-Clause 10.1 [Taking Over of the Works and Sections] is or will be delayed by any of the following causes:\n\n(b) a cause of delay giving an entitlement to extension of time under a Sub-Clause of these Conditions,\n\nc) Chronology of Events\n\n196. As per the Detailed Work Programme submitted on 07 September 202386, access date for the stabling bay line is 26 March 2023 and accordingly the Contractor planned to commence the activities.\n\n197.

        "ground_truth": "The fragmented handovers and unresolved snag points severely disrupted the Contractor's workflow, leading to costly resource shifts, delays in work completion, and idling of equipment and manpower. The limited sections made available for work, such as the mere 1.95 km out of the handed-over 9.42 km, delayed plinth casting and track installation. Moreover, the ongoing occupation of sections by other contractors and unaddressed snag points led to further delays, as materials such as welded rail panels could not be fully deployed.",
        "contexts": [
            " Critical works such as grouting of bearings and the issuance of ICCF-10 by the Civil Contractor were completed only on 1st February 2024, causing over five months of delay for the Track Contractor to proceed with plinth casting\n\n232. On 25 March 2024106, the Engineer issued a formal communication to the Contractor highlighting significant concerns over delays in achieving key dates of elevated structure and test track with substantial completion of work. The Engineer emphasized that the Contractor\u2019s inability to meet these milestones violates the requirements outlined in the Contract and exposes them to delay damages as per the applicable clauses, including GCC and PCC provisions. The communication concluded with a reminder that further non-compliance could invoke contractual penalties, stressing the need for urgent corrective measures.\n\n233. On 26 March 2024107, the Engineer issued the Contractor the notice for the shortfall in the works of elevated section.\n\n234. On 10 April 2024108, the Contractor notified the Employer about unresolved issues, including the closure of snag points and the failure to remove shuttering and other construction materials from the handed-over site, which caused disruptions to the planned works.\n\n235. On 18 April 2024109, the Contractor notified the Employer that the availability of work fronts on the viaduct section did not align with the agreed contractual terms. The viaduct sections were handed over to the Contractor in fragmented portions, disrupting the continuity of work.\n\n104 Engineer\u2019s letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-02-24-839 dated 05 February 2024 105 Engineer\u2019s letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-ECV02-CON-02-24-2063 dated 05 February 2024 106 Engineer letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-03-24-889 dated 25 March 2024 107 Engineer letter No. AEON-IRCON-FO-C4-TRK01-CON-03-24-892 dated 26 March 2024 108 Contractor Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC-2/1052 dated 10 April 2024 109 Contractor\u2019s Letter no.

On 29 April 2024110, the Engineer acknowledged that delays in access dates have occurred and indicates that these will be dealt with as per the relevant provisions of the contract. This implicitly validates the Contractor's concerns about delayed handover affecting their performance. The letter specifically mentions that a 6 km stretch from Porur Bypass was handed over in a phased manner starting February 2023. This phased approach has likely disrupted the Contractor\u2019s planning and execution.\n\n237. The Engineer points out that plinth concreting began only in February 2024, despite the handover starting in February 2023. This delay indirectly highlights that the conditions or access provided to the Contractor may not have been conducive for timely commencement of work.\n\n238. On 19 July 2024111, the Contractor notified the Employer of a primary breach of Contract due to the failure to meet the agreed key dates for the handover of civil works, which are critical for the progress of track work.

Further, despite the Employer's failure to hand over sections as per the agreed schedule, the Contractor has been unfairly blamed for poor progress. The Contract does not allow for piecemeal handovers, yet only intermittent sections totaling 9.42 km were provided, causing costly resource shifts and delays, with significant portions still occupied by other contractors. As a result, only 1.95 km was fit for plinth casting, and even forcibly handed-over sections, like the stretch from P/420 to P/459, were unfit for work due to snag points. Additionally, although the section between P305 and P309 was formally handed over in March 2024, the Civil Contractor continued to occupy the site, obstructing the Contractor\u2019s work for over a month, an issue raised with the Employer in June 2024\n\n240. Even as on 19 July 2024112, the entire viaduct stretch beyond P449 had not been handed over, preventing the full placement of the panels in their original positions. This had created a significant obstacle for the plinth construction work, which had been performed only between P424 and P438, covering 316 TRM. Any work beyond P438 had been stalled due to the lack of\n\n112 Contractor\u2019s Letter No. IRCON/4024/CMRL-TRK-01/GC-2/1217 dated 19 July 2024\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 79 of 116\n\nContract Package: CMRL CORRIDOR 4 PHASE 2 Contractor\u2019s Interim Submission for Extension of Time\n\nhandover and unresolved snag points beyond P449, particularly affecting the area between P438 and POO-SP2.\n\n241. Additionally, multiple welded panels had been lying in between P449 to P559 since Mullai Thottam station area civil work had still not been completed, further obstructing the plinth construction.\n\nd) Cause & Effect Analysis\n\n242. The primary cause of the delays in the construction of the elevated section and the progress of track works is the piecemeal and partial handover of key sections and not as per the dates agreed in Detailed Work Programme, contrary to the Contract's stipulation for full and hindrance-free access of the sections as per IWP. Although the Contractor was prepared with materials and had mobilized resources to proceed as per the schedule, critical areas were handed over in fragmented stretches, each riddled with unresolved snag points. These issues were compounded by civil contractors occupying sections post-handover, preventing the Contractor from efficiently utilizing the work fronts. Furthermore, critical civil works, such as plinth casting and alignment preparations, were delayed or incomplete, restricting the Contractor\u2019s ability to proceed with track laying.\n\n243. The fragmented handovers and unresolved snag points severely disrupted the Contractor's workflow, leading to costly resource shifts, delays in work completion, and idling of equipment and manpower. The limited sections made available for work, such as the mere 1.95 km out of the handed-over 9.42 km, delayed plinth casting and track installation. Moreover, the ongoing occupation of sections by other contractors and unaddressed snag points led to further delays, as materials such as welded rail panels could not be fully deployed, hind"
