These increases were partially offset by (i) a $19 million decrease due to a changed method of amortization as discussed in Note 1\u2014 Background \"\u2014 Change in Accounting Estimates\", (ii) a $12 million decrease related to changes in our CDN customer relationships, and (iii) an $11 million decrease due to certain customer relationship intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFurther analysis of our segment operating expenses by segment is provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\n\nGoodwill Impairment\n\nWe are required to perform impairment tests related to our goodwill annually, which we perform as of October 31, or sooner if an indicator of impairment occurs. The sustained decline in our share price during the second quarter of 2023 was considered a triggering event requiring evaluation of goodwill impairment.\n\nWe report under two segments: Business and Mass Markets. As of June 30, 2023, we had three reporting units for goodwill impairment\n\ntesting, which were (i) Mass Markets, (ii) North America Business and (iii) Asia Pacific region.\n\nWhen we performed an impairment test during the second quarter of 2023, we concluded that the estimated fair value of certain of our\n\nreporting units was less than their carrying value of equity as of our testing date. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge aggregating to $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nSee Note 2\u2014Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements in this report for\n\nfurther details on these tests and impairment charges.\n\n53\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOther Consolidated Results\n\nThe following tables summarize our total other income (expense), net and income tax expense:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n% Change\n\n(Dollars in millions)\n\nInterest expense Net loss on early retirement of debt Other income (expense), net\n\nTotal other expense, net\n\n$\n\n$\n\n(351) (1) 54 (298)\n\n(295) \u2014 (13) (308)\n\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n\n$\n\n(24)\n\n(7)\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n% Change\n\nInterest expense Net gain on early retirement of debt Other income (expense), net\n\nTotal other expense, net\n\n$\n\n$\n\n(Dollars in millions) (1,015) 277 321 (417)\n\n(868) 618 (37) (287)\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n$\n\n29\n\n208\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________ nm Percentages greater than 200% and comparisons between positive and negative values or to/from zero values are considered not meaningful.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased by $56 million and $147 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Nevertheless, for all other purposes of this Agreement, the payments shall be deemed to have commenced on the date they would have had the Employee not been a Specified Employee, and payment of any remaining benefits shall be made as otherwise scheduled hereunder.\n\n3.4 Accrued Obligations and Other Benefits. It is the intent of this Agreement that upon termination of employment for any reason following a Change of Control the Employee or his legal representatives be entitled to receive promptly, and in addition to any other benefits specifically provided, (a) the Employee\u2019s Base Salary through the date of termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (b) any accrued vacation pay, to the extent not theretofore paid, and (c) any other amounts or benefits required to be paid or provided or which the Employee or his legal representatives are entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice or agreement of the Company.\n\n3.5 Stock Options and Other Incentives.

The parachute payments reduced under this section shall be those that the Employee determines provide the Employee the best economic benefit and, to the extent any parachute payments are economically equivalent with each other, each shall be reduced pro rata; provided, however, that the Employee may elect to have the non-cash payments and benefits due the Employee reduced or eliminated prior to any reduction of the cash payments due under this Agreement.\n\n(b) All determinations required to be made under this Section 3.6 shall be made by the accounting firm that was the Company\u2019s independent auditor prior to the Change of Control or any other third party mutually acceptable to the Employee and the Company (the \u201cAccounting Firm\u201d). The Accounting Firm shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the Employee. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Absent manifest error, any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Employee.\n\n(c) For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which any payments would constitute a \u201cparachute payment\u201d (i) no portion of any payments or benefits that the Employee shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a \u201cpayment\u201d within the meaning of section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no",

The Company agrees to reimburse the Employee for all legal fees and other expenses which the Employee may reasonably incur as a result of any contest by the Company or the Post-Transaction Company of the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Agreement, but only if, when and to the extent the Employee prevails with respect to such contest.\n\nPage 14 of 20\n\nExhibit 10.2\n\n3.8 Set-Off; Mitigation. After a Change of Control, the obligations of the Company and its Affiliates to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the Company or its Affiliates may have against the Employee or others, other than as expressly provided to the contrary in Section 3.3(a)(iv), Section 3.10 or Section 4.3. It is the intent of this Agreement that in no event shall the Employee be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action to mitigate the amounts or benefits payable to the Employee under any of the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n3.9 Certain Pre-Change-of-Control Terminations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Employee\u2019s employment shall be deemed to have been terminated following a Change of Control by the Company without Cause (and the Employee shall be entitled to receive all payments and benefits associated therewith) if the Employee\u2019s employment is terminated by the Company or any of its Affiliates without Cause prior to a Change of Control (whether or not a Change of Control actually occurs) and such termination (i) was at the request or direction of a third party who has taken steps designed to effect a Change of Control or otherwise arose in connection with or in anticipation of a Change of Control or (ii) occurred after discussions with a third party regarding a possible Change of Control transaction commenced and such discussions produced (whether before or after such termination) either a preliminary or definitive agreement with respect to such a transaction or a public announcement of the pending transaction (whether or not a Change of Control actually occurs.\n\n3.10 Other Severance Plans. If the Employee becomes entitled to receive severance benefits under this Article III, the Company shall not be required to pay the Employee any additional severance payment under any other severance or salary continuation policy, plan, agreement or arrangement maintained by the Company or its Affiliates unless such other policy, plan, agreement or arrangement expressly provides to the contrary.\n\nARTICLE IV NONDISCLOSURE AND NONSOLICITATION\n\n4.1 Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. The Employee acknowledges and agrees that in the course of the Employee\u2019s employment the Employee has been in a position to have access to and develop Confidential Information, and will continue to be in position to receive and develop Confidential Information during the Employee\u2019s tenure as an employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates. As long as the Employee is an employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, the Employee shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company all Confidential Information which the Employee obtained during the Employee\u2019s employment (whether prior to or after the Agreement Date) and shall use such Confidential Information solely in the good faith performance of his duties for the Company and its Affiliates. If the employment of the Employee is terminated for any reason, then, commencing with the termination date and continuing until the fifth anniversary of such date, the Employee shall (a) not communicate, divulge or make available to any Person (other than the Company and its Affiliates) any such Confidential Information, except with the prior written consent of the Company or as may be required by law"

        "question": "How did JNPT yard issues impact the 2022 project timeline and environmental compliance?",
        "ground_truth": "The JNPT yard issues impacted the 2022 project timeline and environmental compliance due to the presence of mangroves from Ch. - (0+850) to Ch. - (0+600) and from Ch. 1 +570 to Ch. 2+140, for which requisite permission for removal was not obtained. While other stretches had mangroves cleared in the first half of 2022, the presence of live IR tracks within the ROW, which were dismantled and decommissioned as late as Feb-22, also contributed to delays. Additionally, dismantled material like sleepers was not removed from the ROW, and the presence of signaling cables and telecommunication installations of IR caused encumbrances and infringements, which were removed in March 22.",

            " 12-Feb-18, the Employer had\n\ninformed and assured that the issue of encumbrance in the Vasai detour stretch i.e. Ch. 82 to 92 shall be resolved and encumbrance free land shall be handed over progressively by Dec-18. The Engineer while responding to the Contractor's contentions in Priority Sections - 1 in between Ch. 67+052 to Ch. 101+625, vide its letter 2843 dated 13-May-21, has also acknowledged about the encumbrances in stretch from Ch. 86 to Ch. 91+700 and informed that the Employer is in process of resolving R & R issues and the 3.240 km land in this stretch shall be handed over progressively. Further, the demolition drive to clear the encumbrances within the ROW in the said stretch was conducted in the month of May 2022 wherein majority of the encumbrances were cleared. However, it is also to be noted that intermediate minor encumbrances of structures, temples, water tanks, toilets etc. were not cleared in the demolition drive due to which the entire ROW was not clear, the details of which are given in Contractor's letter no. 11078 dated 08-Jun-22. Since then , the intermediate encumbrances are being removed with time.\n\n2.2.2.1. It is clearly evident that the Engineer/Employer could not provide Right of Access pursuant to \"Sub clause 2.1 of Part II: Part A: Appendix to Bid'', in terms of its Length and within contractual timelines.\n\n2.2.2.2. It is also evident from the above that the Engineer has given a misleading statement on this matter and further. the Employer failed in handing over the land within 28, 91 and 182 days' requirements on time. Till date. full length of Land , that too free from hindrances/obstructions/encumbrances. is not accessible to the Contractor. The areas for which Right to Access and Possession of Site is given is also not free from various encumbrances I hindrances I obstructions.\n\n2.2.2.3. Merely stating repeatedly that land has been handed over does not mean that the Right to Access to, and possession of site has been given to the .;<-~~:~f ~~~:\u00b7.'G,ontractor.

It is an obligation of the parties to co-operate in order for the Contractor to be able to execute the Works and unless specifically stated otherwise it is in implied terms that the parties should co-operate in this goal of executing the Works. The extent of this obligation to provide access and obtain permissions will depend upon others; the type of work involved; the extent of possession ; the control of adjacent areas exercised by that party; together with any other relevant circumstances. Even where the term is implied that physical access is to be provided by one party, the term may not extend to requiring that party to be held responsible for the suitability of the Access to the Site.\n\n2.2.2.11 . The term possession or use or occupation is to describe the Contractor's right to enter the Site, occupy and use the Site and carry out the specified Works. During the Contract Period, possession will usually provide the Contractor with such exclusive occupation and use the Site as required to construct the Works .\n\n2.2.2.12. The meaning and extent of possession of the Site, and the apportionment of risk for events that interfere with possession, will depend upon the express and implied terms of the Contract. The extent of uninterrupted possession will depend generally upon the nature of the work.\n\n2. 2.2.13. The Contractor is generally entitled to possession of more than the actual site on which the structure stands in order to carry out the works. This will usually include reasonable working space.\n\n2.2.2.14. The extent to which the",
            " possession is free of interference depends upon the type of work and all the circumstances and particularly the express terms of the Contract. Where the Contractor takes responsibility for the safety of the works throughout the site and for the method of constructing the works, then it is likely that the Contractor will be considered to have exclusive possession of the Site in order to give him the required control of the Site. This w ill be subject to express terms, and the implied right of access to the Employer for monitoring, supervision and administration of the Contract.\n\n2.2.2. 15. Submissions made in the above paras very clearly establish that Right of Access, Possession of Site and Hand Over don't have the same meaning. Therefore, only providing handing over note to Contractor and stating that Right of Access and Possession of Site was available to the Contractor is a misleading statement. Instead, Employer I Engineer should have handed over the Land within timelines and in\n\nPage 17 of 68\n\nPage 23\n\nExpress Freight Railway Consortium\n\n2.1 of PCC/GCC and that too free from all encumbrances, hindrances & obstructions etc.\n\nThe Contractor also makes it clear that the Employer has not adhered to that, initially possession of the site will be handed over to the Contractor in continuous stretches of at least 1 Okms. Thereafter, the Employee shall make effort to hand over site in chunks of at least 5km length in isolated locations or minimum 1 km in stretches in continuation to the previously possessed stretch.\n\n2.3. Delay in handing over of land and other encumbrances affecting works in JNPT\n\nyard and IR Panvel yard.\n\n2.3.1. DFCC tracks are passing through the IR Panvel yard (Ch. 23+300 to Ch. 25+000) wh ich need to be dismantled by Indian Railways (IR) and thereafter handed over to DFCC for extant Project works. As per approved CCP, the formation and Track works between Ch. 19.50 Km to Ch. 27.00 Km were planned to be completed by 26-Jun-19 and 18-Mar-20 respectively conditional that the encumbrance free land is handed over to the Contractor by 10-Apr-17. The total duration of 782 days is required for the above to activities to be carried out in the said stretch as per the approved CCP. However, to date, the said land has not been handed over by the IR and therefore the Contractor is not able to proceed with the works wh ich shall delay the overall completion of the Project. Further, the ROW in the JNPT yard is also encumbered with the presence of Mangroves from Ch . - (0+850) to Ch. - (0+600) and from Ch. 1 +570 to Ch. 2+ 140 as the requisite permission for removal of the same is not obtained. While the other stretches also had mangroves which were cleared in the first half of 2022. Also, there was presence of live IR tracks within the ROW which were dismantled and decommissioned in the month as late as Feb-22. Further, the dismantled material like sleepers was also not removed from the ROW rather kept lying there. The Contractor being proactive had removed the same at his cost for the betterment of the progress. Also, there was presence of Signaling Cables and Telecommunication Installations of IR infringing along the alignment, causing encumbrances and infringements across the length of the Site at varied depth, which were removed on March 22. Because of all of this, the\n\nPage 18 of 68\n\nPage 24\n\nExpress Freight Railway Consortium\n\napproved by Engineer/Employer as on 31 -0ct-2022. The correspondences pertaining to delay in RUB-67 is given in Exhibit# 12.\n\nlist of\n\n2.10.11.4. Thus, on account of the additional requirement of MSRDC and the delay in finalization of design and drawings of the aforesaid RUB, the Contractor considers its entitlement for Extension of Time for Completion of the subject Project.

We include amortized fulfillment costs in cost of services and products and amortized acquisition costs in Selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of operations. We include the amount of these deferred costs that are anticipated to be amortized in the next twelve months in Other under Current Assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We include the amount of deferred costs expected to be amortized beyond the next twelve months in Other under Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We assess deferred acquisition and fulfillment costs for impairment on a quarterly basis.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(4) Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n\nTo assess our expected credit losses on financial instruments, we aggregate financial assets with similar risk characteristics to monitor\n\ntheir credit quality or deterioration over the life of such assets. We periodically monitor certain risk characteristics within our aggregated financial assets and revise their composition accordingly, to the extent internal and external risk factors change. We separately evaluate financial assets that do not share risk characteristics with other financial assets. Our financial assets measured at amortized cost primarily consist of accounts receivable.\n\nWe use a loss rate method to estimate our allowance for credit losses. Our determination of the current expected credit loss rate begins with our review of historical loss experience as a percentage of accounts receivable. We measure our historical loss period based on the average days to recognize accounts receivable as credit losses. When asset specific characteristics and current conditions change from those in the historical period, due to changes in our credit and collections strategy, certain classes of aged balances, or credit loss and recovery policies, we perform a qualitative and quantitative assessment to adjust our historical loss rate. We use regression analysis to develop an expected loss rate using historical experience and economic data over a forecast period. We measure our forecast period based on the average days to collect payment on billed accounts receivable. To determine our current allowance for credit losses, we combine the historical and expected credit loss rates and apply them to our period end accounts receivable.\n\nIf there is an unexpected deterioration of a customer's financial condition or an unexpected change in economic conditions, including macroeconomic events, we assess the need to adjust the allowance for credit losses. Any such resulting adjustments would affect earnings in the period that adjustments are made.\n\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, current conditions and forecasted economic conditions\n\nrequires judgment. Alternative interpretations of these factors could have resulted in different conclusions regarding our allowance for credit losses. The amount of credit loss is sensitive to changes in circumstances and forecasted economic conditions. Our historical credit loss experience, current conditions and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of the customers' actual default experience in the future, and we may use methodologies that differ from those used by other companies.\n\nThe following table presents the activity of our allowance for credit losses by accounts receivable portfolio for the six months ended\n\nJune 30, 2024:\n\nAs of December 31, 2023\n\nProvision for expected losses Write-offs charged against the allowance Recoveries collected\n\nEnding balance at June 30, 2024\n\n$\n\n$\n\nBusiness\n\n36 13 (19) 4 34\n\nMass Markets (Dollars in millions) 31 26 (31) 2 28\n\n21\n\nTotal\n\n67 39 (50) 6 62\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(5) Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\n\nAt June 30, 2024, most of our outstanding consolidated debt had been incurred by us or one of the following three subsidiaries, each of\n\nwhich has borrowed funds either on a standalone basis or as part of a separate restricted group with certain of its subsidiaries:\n\n\n\nLevel 3 Financing, Inc.

We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to borrow additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. See \"Risk Factors\u2014Financial Risks\" in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nPotential Transactions Impacting Liquidity\n\nSubsequent to the end of the second quarter 2024, we announced that we recently sold $5 billion in new Private Connectivity Fabric solutions. The majority of cash from these agreements is expected to be received over the next 3 to 4 years. We will incur certain material expenditures in connection with these custom network agreements, and the majority of such expenditures are also expected to be made over the next 3 to 4 years. The payments we actually make and receive may vary materially from what we expect and will depend, among other things, on the timing of our delivery and installation of the services.\n\nFrom time to time over the past couple of years, we have engaged in various debt refinancings, redemptions, tender offers, exchange\n\noffers, open market purchases and other transactions designed principally to reduce our consolidated indebtedness, extend our debt maturities, improve our financial flexibility or otherwise enhance our debt profile. Subject to market conditions, restrictions under our debt covenants, and other limitations, we expect to opportunistically pursue similar transactions in the future to the extent feasible. See Note 5\u2014 Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities for additional information.\n\n61\n\nSM\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFederal Income Tax Obligations\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Lumen Technologies had approximately $800 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\")\n\nwhich, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may be used to offset future taxable income. These NOLs are primarily related to federal NOLs we acquired through the Level 3 acquisition on November 1, 2017 and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"Section 382\"). We maintain a Section 382 rights agreement designed to safeguard through late 2026 our ability to use those NOLs. We utilized a substantial portion of our previously available NOLs to offset taxable gains generated by the completion of our 2022 divestitures. We expect to use substantially all of our remaining NOLs in future periods in accordance with Section 382's annual limitations, although we cannot assure this. See \"Risk Factors\u2014Financial Risks\u2014We may not be able to fully utilize our NOLs\" in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For these reasons, we anticipate that our cash income tax liability will increase in future periods.\n\nIn January 2024, we received a federal income tax cash refund of $729 million, including interest. The amounts of our near-term future tax payments will depend upon many factors, including our future earnings and tax circumstances and the impact of any potential corporate tax reform legislation or taxable transactions.\n\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which, among other things, implemented a corporate alternative minimum tax (\u201cCAMT\u201d) on adjusted financial statement income effective for tax periods occurring after December 31, 2022. The CAMT had no material impact on our financial results as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation, some of which are effective for tax periods after December 31, 2023. While the global minimum tax will increase our administrative and compliance burdens, we expect that it will have an immaterial impact on our financial statements for the tax period ending December 31, 2024.\n\nStock Repurchases\n\nEffective November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a two-year program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion of\n\nour outstanding common stock (the \"November 2022 stock repurchase program\"). During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock under this program. As of June 30, 2024, we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $1.3 billion of our outstanding common stock under this program. We currently do not plan to purchase any shares of our outstanding common stock under this program.\n\nPension and Post-retirement Benefit Obligations\n\nWe are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans.
