The term of the agreement is seven years and may be renewed for an additional 12 month term, upon mutual agreement of both parties.\n\nMaster Services Agreement\n\nThe Company and DNS entered into master service agreements pursuant to which each party can use the other party to provide services, parts and licensed software to support customers in the specific regions. The party acting as the vendor will be eligible for payment for such services. The term of the agreement is one year and will be automatically renewed for an additional 12-month term, unless the other party provides notice of non-renewal 60 days prior to renewal.\n\nTransactions with divested entities\n\nThe Company incurred $0.6 million and $1.2 million engineering, research and development and other professional expenses related to the Transition Services Agreement and Master Engineering Services Agreement with DNS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. These expense are allocated between research and product development and selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\n\nThe Company provided various services to DNS in conjunction with the Transition Services Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a cross charge of $0.2 million and $0.4 million related to such services reducing its research and product development and selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss.\n\nThe Company also enters in inventory purchase arrangements with DNS as part of its operating activity.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, balances arising from transactions with DNS included $10.2 million accounts payable and $0.7 million other receivables, net of allowance for credit losses.\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(3) Business Combinations\n\nNetComm Acquisition\n\nOn June 1, 2024 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding equity of NetComm Wireless Pty Ltd and its subsidiary (collectively \u201cNetComm\u201d) from Casa Communications Holdings Pty Ltd (\u201cCasa Communications\u201d) for a combination of cash and contingent consideration (the \"NetComm Acquisition\"). NetComm is a leading broadband networking innovator in the 5G fixed wireless, home broadband, fiber- extension and IoT technology domains. NetComm serves communications service providers and enterprise customers in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. The primary driver for the acquisition was to expand the Company's product portfolio and accelerate growth opportunities in foreign markets.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement with Casa Communications, all rights, titles, and interests in the shares of NetComm were acquired for approximately $8.1 million in cash in addition to contingent consideration, determined based on the revenues from existing, agreed-upon customers during the year ended December 31, 2024. The contingent consideration in this arrangement includes future cash payments of varying amounts based on the 2024 revenue thresholds achieved, starting at $72.5 million, with a maximum payout of $3.0 million. This contingent consideration was determined to be liability-classified, as it is settled solely in cash, and the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Closing Date, approximately $0.1 million, was determined using the income approach, specifically a Monte-Carlo simulation, a Level 3 fair value approach due to the lack of relevant market activity and significant management judgment, which used the following significant assumptions: projected financial information, volatility (30.0%), discount rate (12.1%), risk-free rate (5.4%), and cost of debt (13.5%). The Company will be required to remeasure this liability to fair value quarterly with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final payment is made.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations, with the Company identified as the acquirer. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price has been assigned to the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred acquisition-related costs of $0.9 million, which were expensed in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the purchase price allocation for the acquisition is provisional, pending the completion of management\u2019s review of the valuation of the acquired intangible assets, determination of the associated income tax impacts, and determination of the final bargain purchase gain.\n\nThe table below sets forth the consideration paid, the provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the estimated bargain purchase gain for the acquisition (in thousands):\n\nConsideration Paid Cash Contingent consideration\n\n$\n\nTotal Consider"

The same has been accepted/acknowledged by the Engineer as well. As a result, Park Island Refurbishment Work for Phase-1 was delayed, consequently delaying the completion of the same.\n\nBased on the above, the Contractor is of the opinion that the following works were affected for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor:\n\nIssue Start Date Finish Date Duration Remarks Suspension of MEP Works for the Park Island Phase-1 due to discrepancy between drawings and site conditions 16-Oct-24 06-Nov-24 22 As evident from the log and the correspondences above: The discrepancies were highlighted by the Contractor to the Engineer on 14 October 2024 itself, right when the demolition works were getting completed and the Contractor was planning to commence the MEP First Fix Plumbing works. The said works were on hold for more than three weeks and were only resumed on 07 November 2024\n\n\n\nDelay Fragnet\n\nThe following is the list of delay fragnet considered in the delay analysis to assess the impact of the subject event on the completion date of the Project:\n\nDelay Event ID Delay Event Name Start Date Finish Date Delay Duration (in days) DE-03-01 Suspension of MEP works due to discrepancy between drawings and site conditions 16-Oct-24 6-Nov-24 22\n\nImpact Assessment\n\nThe delay events spanned between 14 October 2024 & 6 November 2024.\n\nThe following were the Planned completion dates for the Project as per the Baseline Programme:\n\nHand Over Dates Completion Date (Baseline Programme) Hand Over for Park Island 17-Mar-25 Project Completion 30-Mar-25\n\nThe Contractor has inserted DE-03-01 in the impacted programme for DE-02 (i.e., in the Annexure D) to conduct the delay analysis and assessment as per the step insertion of delay events explained in Part 5 of this Report to understand the cumulative impact of this delay to the Project Completion:\n\nImpacted Activities/Added Relationship\n\nThis delay fragnet was then linked to the following activities, which were affected due to this delay event:\n\nDelay Event ID Delay Event Name Successor/ Impacted Activity DE-03-01 Suspension of MEP Works for the Park Island Phase-1 due to discrepancy between drawings and site conditions [FS] PI-P1-MEP.REF-7260: Water Supply Pipe Routing Modification Works [FS] PI-P1-MEP.REF-7270: Drainage Pipe Routing Modification Works [FS] PI-P1-MEP.REF-7470: Water Supply Pipe Routing Modification Works [FS] PI-P1-MEP.REF-7480: Drainage Pipe Routing Modification Works\n\n\n\nConsequently, the Contractor noted the following impact on the major events:\n\nHand Over dates Baseline Programme Impacted Programme after DE 03 Finish Finish Hand Over for Park Island 17-Mar-25 25-Apr-25 Project Completion 30-Mar-25 25-Apr-25\n\nBased on the results of the impacted programme (attached as Annexure E), the Contractor highlights that, due to this delay event, the project completion in the impacted programme is now driven by the completion of the refurbishment works at Park Island, and is shifted to 25 April 2025.\n\nAccordingly, the impact of delay event DE-03: \u2018Suspension of Refurbishment Works for the Park Island Phase-1 due to discrepancy between drawings and site conditions\u2019 on the Project Completion is summarised as follows:\n\nDescription Date of Project Completion Cumulative EOT entitlement (in days) EOT entitlement (in days) due to event DE-02 Additional EOT entitlement (in days) due to event DE-03 Baseline Programme Completion Date (After Impact of DE-03) A B C = B-A D E = D-C Project Completion 30-Mar-25 25-Apr-25 26 13 13\n\n\n\nDE-04: DELAY IN CEILING CLOSURE WORKS IN PARK ISLAND PHASE-1 DUE TO DELAY IN FIREFIGHTING WORKS BY THE EMPLOYER\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe ceiling closure works in Park Island Phase-1 were delayed due to pending firefighting pipe installations, which are a prerequisite for finalizing the ceiling works such as board closure and painting works. These delays occurred due to the Employer\u2019s inability to mobilize its subcontractor (AMC) on time and address site conditions effectively. Consequently, the Contractor is entitled to an Extension of Time (EOT) to account for the delays caused",
            " by the Employer's delay in executing the firefighting works planned for this Project.\n\nContractual Entitlement\n\nThe Contractor claims its entitlement for EOT under Clause 19.2 of the Conditions of the Contract.\n\nThe Clause 19.2 Conditions of the Contract states:\n\nThe Engineer may determine, after due consultation with the Contractor and the Employer's Representative, a reasonable extension to Time for Completion of the whole of the Works or of any Section or Portion of the Works where delay to the Works is due to:\n\nany variation of the Works made pursuant to a Variation Order issued under Clause 23.1 (Variation Orders) but in evaluating the reasonableness of the period of any extension required as a result of any such variation account shall be taken of any other variation which has caused a decrease in the Works or has otherwise change in the quantity of an item of work included in the Contract reduced the time the Contractor should reasonably need for completion thereof; or\n\nany Suspension Order under Clause 18.1 (Suspension Order) except in relation to a suspension within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) inclusive of Clause 18.1; or\n\nany of the excepted risks as defined in Clause 13.4 (Risk and Care) occurring or\n\nany delay, impediment or prevention by Employer, or\n\nany Force Majeure events as defined in Clause 33 (Force Majeure) ...\n\nBased on the above contractual provisions, the Contractor is entitled to an EOT and associated costs under Sub-clause 19.2(d) due to delays caused by the Employer\u2019s inability to facilitate firefighting installations on time.\n\n\n\nChronology of Events\n\nOn 6 December 2024, two key emails were exchanged:\n\nThe Contractor raised concerns about water leakage/condensation in the existing copper piping, highlighting that firefighting rectifications were pending and the delay was affecting the ceiling closure and flooring works. The Contractor emphasized the need for urgency in addressing these issues\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Employer confirmed via email that insulation works for the firefighting system would commence on 9 December 2024, and further coordination with the subcontractor was expected to be followed\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn 10 December 2024, the Contractor notified the Employer of delays in firefighting works and highlighted that no subcontractor personnel were available on-site. The Contractor emphasized that the ceiling closure works were being delayed and requested the Employer to mobilize the required workforce\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn 16 December 2024, the subcontractor (AMC) visited the site and confirmed that the sprinkler relocation job could be completed in a single day. However, they required approval to discharge the sprinkler lines. The Contractor raised concerns that further delays were caused by pending approvals from the Facilities Management (FM) team\u200b\u200b of the Employer.\n\nOn 25 December 2024, the Contractor asked the Employer to finalize firefighting works, including tracing the required cables. The firefighting installations were completed the same day, allowing the Contractor to take up the remaining ceiling closure works\u200b from 26 December 2024.\n\nIt is noted from the latest impacted programme or DE-03 (Annexure E) that the Employer\u2019s subcontractor had to execute the firefighting piping works by 20 November 2024. However, it was actually executed on 25 December 2024.\n\nBased on the above-mentioned correspondences, it is evident that the Contractor had notified the issues and highlighted the delays caused by the Employer's subcontractor and pending approvals. Accordingly, the ceiling closure works were on hold for a total of 32 days, from 21 November 2024 to 24 December 2024.\n\nBased on the above, the Contractor is of the opinion that the following works were affected for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor:\n\nIssue Start Date Finish Date Duration Remarks Delay in Ceiling Closure works in Park Island Phase-1 due to Delay in Firefighting works by the Employer 21-Nov-24 24-Dec-24 32 As evident from the correspondences above: The delays in firefighting works were highlighted by the Contractor to the Engineer from 06 November 2024 onwards, to complete the remaining works for ceiling.\n\nDelay Fragnet\n\nThe following is the delay impact due to the subject event on the Project Completion Date:\n\nDelay Event ID Delay Event Name Start Date Finish Date Delay Duration (in days) DE-04-01 Delay in ceiling closure works due to delay in firefighting works by the Employer 21-Nov-24 24-Dec-24 32\n\nImpact Assessment\n\nThe delay events spanned between 21 November 2024 and 24 December 2024.\n\nThe following were the planned completion dates of the key Project Milestones as per the Baseline Programme:\n\nKey Project Milestone Completion Date (Baseline Programme) Hand Over for Park Island 17-Mar-"

The Company provides a wide array of reliable, cost-effective networking technologies and cloud software to a diverse customer base.\n\nDZS was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 1999. The Company is headquartered in Plano, Texas with contract manufacturers located in the U.S., China, India, and Korea. The Company maintains offices to provide sales and customer support at global locations. Through 2022, we have also used our manufacturing facility in Seminole, Florida. In October 2022, we announced an agreement with Fabrinet, a third-party provider of electromechanical and electronic manufacturing and distribution services, to transition the sourcing, procurement, order-fulfillment, manufacturing and return merchandise authorization activities in the Company's Seminole facility to Fabrinet. The transition began in October 2022 and substantially completed in the beginning of 2023, whereupon the Company no longer manufactures its products.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company completed a divestiture of certain subsidiaries in Asia (the \"Asia Sale\").

(referred to, collectively with its subsidiaries, as \u201cDZS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global provider of access and optical networking infrastructure and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven cloud software solutions that enable the emerging hyper-connected, hyper-broadband world and broadband experiences. The Company provides a wide array of reliable, cost-effective networking technologies and cloud software to a diverse customer base.\n\nDZS was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 1999. The Company is headquartered in Plano, Texas with contract manufacturers located in the U.S., China, India, and Korea. The Company maintains offices to provide sales and customer support at global locations. Through 2022, we have also used our manufacturing facility in Seminole, Florida. In October 2022, we announced an agreement with Fabrinet, a third-party provider of electromechanical and electronic manufacturing and distribution services, to transition the sourcing, procurement, order-fulfillment, manufacturing and return merchandise authorization activities in the Company's Seminole facility to Fabrinet. The transition began in October 2022 and substantially completed in the beginning of 2023, whereupon the Company no longer manufactures its products.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company completed a divestiture of certain subsidiaries in Asia (the \"Asia Sale\"). The divestiture allows DZS to focus on the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Australia/New Zealand (ANZ) regions that are strategically aligned with the technology and acquisition investments made over the past several years.\n\n(b) Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 3 of Regulation S-X.

        "ground_truth": "The specific challenges or conditions in the Development of ROP Border Post at Sarfait project that led to the proposal of replacing the original RCC wall with a secant piling wall included the loose and unsuitable nature of the soil, which was built-up, without compaction, negligible cohesion, and almost no strength. The original design did not consider these parameters and proposed RCC walls without shoring, which was not suitable for the existing conditions. Specialist reports recommended changes to the design of the retaining wall, emphasizing that if the initial design had considered the true soil conditions and proposed piling or shoring instead of an RC wall, the issues regarding soil collapse and subsequent changes and delays could have been avoided.",

            " not revise the design despite\n\nwitnessing the soil conditions.\n\n72. A major landslide occurred on April 12, 2016. This was followed by a series of inspections\n\nand specialist third-party geotechnical investigations. In the report titled 'Urgent Case Study'\n\ndated April 24, 2016, the engineer informed the employer about the possible cause of soil\n\ncollapse. The engineer highlighted that the entire site is situated on a thick layer of built-up\n\nsoil, which is loose, without any compaction, negligible cohesion, and almost no strength.\n\n73. Despite the loose and unsuitable nature of the soil for the original design, the engineer\n\nalleged the soil collapse as a constructability issue. However, the contractor disagreed and\n\ndemonstrated with records that they followed the process and repeatedly highlighted to the\n\nengineer and employer the loose nature of the soil and the potential for collapse. As the\n\nmatter progressed, specialist reports recommended changes to the design of the retaining\n\nwall. This emphasizes that if the initial design had considered the true soil conditions and\n\nproposed piling or shoring instead of an RC wall, the issues regarding soil collapse and\n\nsubsequent changes and delays could have been avoided. Obviously, the circumstances and\n\nconsequences due to inadequate design were beyond the contractor\u2019s control.\n\n74.\n\nIt is apparent that the original design did not consider these parameters and proposed\n\nRCC walls without shoring. The original design was not suitable for the existing\n\nconditions. Further to additional investigations and recommendations from the\n\nspecialists, the secant piling wall was proposed for Retaining Wall 1, replacing the\n\noriginal RCC wall.\n\n75. The finalization of the secant piling variation was delayed until the end of December 2019.\n\nOnly upon the completion of the secant piling wall, was the contractor able to proceed safely\n\nwith mass excavation and subsequent works. This event and successive design changes\n\ncritically affected the completion of the overall project.\n\nChronology of the Event\n\n35\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF ROP BORDER POST AT SARFAIT\n\nContractor\u2019s Comprehensive Submission for Extension of Time\n\n76. The Contractor through letter dated 21st May 201452 \u2013 Special Observations, recorded that\n\nit excluded the dewatering and shoring from the offer in absence of a soil report.\n\n77. The Contractor vide letter dated 01 October 201453, requested the Engineer to issue\n\nEngineer\u2019s Instruction (EI) with all required details for Soil investigation works as per the\n\ndiscussions held during the kick off meeting held in the Employer\u2019s conference hall on 30\n\nSeptember 2014. However the requirement was refused by the Engineer on 29th October\n\n201454.\n\n78.\n\nIn absence of a detailed soil investigation, the Contractor started the excavation works from\n\nthe lowest level of retaining wall RW-3. The Contractor repeatedly informed Engineer\n\nregarding local soil collapse incidences.\n\n79. A landslide occurred on 12 April 2016, which resulted in significant disruption to work\n\nactivities. The event posed inherent risks to the safety of individuals and property, prompted\n\nthe Contractor to issue notices to the Engineer (Al Hatrny Engineering Consultancy LLC).\n\n80. The Contractor vide its letter dated 17 April 201655, notified the Engineer regarding the\n\nmajor soil collapse observed near Retaining Wall-2, Panel no. 6, 7, 8 and 9 and requested\n\nfor the Engineer/ Employer and Geo Technical engineer\u2019s visit to the site. The Contractor\n\nmentioned that the soil is very unstable and therefore the Contractor stopped the work till\n\nclearance and permanent solution from the Engineer/ Employer\u2019s end.\n\n81. A team comprised of representatives from the Employer and Engineer visited the project\n\nsite on 19 April 2016. Subsequently, the Engineer submitted a preliminary report to the\n\nEmployer on 24 April 201656 and also provided a copy to the Contractor. The report outlined\n\nthe seriousness of the situation, its potential impact, threats, and included certain\n\nrecommendations.

The Contractor noted that the hand-over of units 2000, 5100, 5200, 5300, 5400, 5500, 5800, 6200, 6500, 6900, 3800 was delayed by 7 days by the Employer.\n\nThe delay in handover of Units by the Employer was due to emergent work in Sea water system that was not anticipated in Turn Around (TA) Schedule.\n\nThe Contractor claimed for additional costs incurred by the Contractor in maintaining Manpower, equipment, Flight tickets and Scaffolding for additional 7 days, from 27th October 2023 to 4th Novembre 2023. The Contractor in total claimed for OMR 1,299,941.14 and requested the Employer to approve the additional cost.\n\nThe Employer on 31 July 2024 replied to Contractor\u2019s additional costs submission dated 18 January 2024 and rejected Contractor\u2019s claim. The Employer noted that the Contractor failed to notify the Employer within required time frame and emphasised the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to manage the resources and adopt to minor changes during the turnaround process.\n\nThe Employer noted that as per Clause 44.1 of Contract, the Contractor had to submit the notice within 28 days of the event. The Employer noted that, alleged delay event occurred on 04 November 2023 and the notification was due by 02 December 2023, and the Contractor failed to notify within required timeframe. The Employer also noted that the Contractor should have redeployed resources to other available units.\n\n\n\nOn 18 August 2024, the Contractor replied to Employer letter dated 31 July 2024, disagreeing with the Employer\u2019s statements regarding the rejection of the Claim. The Contractor highlighted that the repair of the 100\u201d GRE SWS line had extended by more than seven days, for which the Contractor bore no responsibility. It was noted that the delay in repair had postponed the handover of the RFCC and Sea Water System units. The Contractor further emphasized that this delay had critically impacted the planned shutdown of the SR1 plant and pointed out that the Employer failed to adhere to the Contract timelines for issuing instructions and approvals.\n\nThe Contractor asserted that the portion of resources remained idle due to 7-day delay and provided the details of idle resources. The Contractor requested an immediate relief for the financial burden caused by the delays and reserved all rights under the Contract and applicable law.\n\nThe Employer on 18 September 2024 replied to Contractor\u2019s letter dated 18 August 2024 and again informed its stand of rejection of Contractor additional cost claim. The Employer again noted that the Contractor failed to notify within 28-day timeframe as per clause 44.2 of Contract. The Employer stated that adequate work front was available to redeploy the resources. The Employer emphasised that there was no evidence of idle manpower and rejected the claim.\n\nThe Employer on 18 September 2024 submitted Contractor with Additional losses due to Contractor\u2019s breach of the Contract. The Employer noted that the Employer issued formal notifications to the Contractor regarding multiple breaches of the Contract during mechanical Works for SR1-PP turnaround Project. The Employer outlined the following key issues:\n\nFailure to meet Qualifications and Performance Standards: The Employer noted that the manpower mobilized did not meet the required qualifications, leading to poor performance.\n\n\n\nSupervision and Quality issues: The Employer noted that inadequate supervision led to quality issues, resulting in the issuance of Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs).\n\nDelays and additional Works: The Employer noted that the Contractor undertook additional works after completing the base scope instead of concurrently, causing critical delays. The Employer also noted that Late discovery of scope changes and delays in inspection activities contributed to further delays. \n\nNon- Compliance with Key Performance Indicators: The Employer noted that the Contractor failed to meet the required KPI thresholds, including incidents such as a fire, first aid cases, safety observations, and violations of Life-Saving Rules. \n\n",
            "The Employer further noted that the Employer incurred losses amounting to OMR 6.7 million and additional OEM costs of OMR 0.26 million due to these breaches and delays and demanded compensation totalling OMR 6.96 million for the losses and additional costs incurred. The Employer further noted that the Employer is entitled to apply a penalty of OMR 1.36 million (10% of the total amount of the call-off orders) due to the contractor's failure to meet the KPI\u2019s.\n\nThe Contractor on 21 October 2024, replied to Employer letters dated 18 September 2024 and clarified its position. The Contractor noted that the Contractor is seeking cost reimbursement due to a delayed handover of units by the Employer, which resulted in idle resources and significant operational impacts. The Contractor noted that the original shutdown of the SR1 plant was scheduled for 27 October 2023 but was delayed by the Employer until 03 November 2023, causing a 7-day delay in a compressed 32-day schedule. The Contractor noted that the Employer initially rejected the cost reimbursement claim, citing the delay as minor and referencing contractual notice requirements. However, the Contractor demonstrated that the Employer\u2019s own timelines for issuing critical instructions exceeded contractual limits.\n\nThe Contractor also noted that the Employer introduced alleged delays, penalties, and damages long after the successful completion of the turnaround (TA), which is an attempt to circumvent their legitimate cost reimbursement claim. The Contractor also emphasized that the Contractor had only claimed reimbursement for idle resource costs \n\n\n\ncaused by the delayed handover and highlighted their significant acceleration efforts to minimize the schedule impact.\n\nThe Contractor further noted that it took considerable efforts to accelerate and mitigate the effects of constraints imposed by the Employer, including:\n\nLate issuance of call-off orders,\n\nDelayed handover of RFCC,\n\nLate material availability,\n\nDelays in retubing of exchangers,\n\nIncreased volume of refractory works and non-availability of refractory casting material,\n\nIncreased volume of SCF (Scope change form) Works,\n\nAdditional repair work directed by the Employer\n\nThe Contractor further reiterated its entitlement to compensation for idle resources and considerable acceleration efforts, including costs associated with additional manpower, equipment. The Contractor requested the Employer to engage in good faith to settle these legitimate claims and avoid further protraction of the matter. The Contractor also noted that it remains available to provide additional substantiation and work towards an equitable resolution, reserving all rights under the contract and law to protect their interests.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and noted that the Employer letter dated 18 September 2024 pertains to additional losses incurred by the Employer due to breaches of contract by the Contractor. The Employer noted that the Contractor's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations has led to financial losses for the Employer, necessitating compensation from the Contractor.\n\n\n\nThe Employer further noted that the Employer is entitled for KPI penalties as per the Contract.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim and noted that the Contractor failed to submit a notice within 28 days after the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim, as required by Clause 44.1 of the Contract. The Employer also noted that the Contractor submitted almost eleven months after the events, leading to Employer\u2019s discharge from liability in connection with the claim.\n\nThe Employer replied to Contractor citations such as late issuance of call-off orders, delayed handover of RFCC, late material availability and pre-TA progress, delay in retubing of exchangers, increase in refractory works in regenerator, increased volume of SCF, SCF for repair of SCSP nozzle. \n\nThe Employer emphasised that the Contractor is not entitled to any additional payment due to its failure to provide timely notification. The Employer also noted that the comprehensive review of each claim submitted by the Contractor finds to be without merit. The Employer noted that it remains open to engaging with the Contractor to discuss the claims and any damages incurred due to the Contractor's poor performance.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim for additional payment due to idle time. The Employer noted that it does not intend to respond to each and every statement or allegation in the Contractor's letter dated 21 October 2024, particularly those unrelated to the idle time claim, such as matters of purported acceleration. Further, the Employer noted that failure to respond to any other statement or allegation in the referenced correspondence shall not be deemed as agreement or admission of the veracity, relevance, or acceptance of such statements or allegations.\n\nThe below points provide the"

            " and prospective Board of Directors members. Therefore, while the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is focused on the achievement and the ability of\n\n92\n\npotential nominees to make a positive contribution with respect to such factors, it has not established any specific minimum criteria or qualifications that a nominee must possess. Upon the identification of a qualified candidate, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee would select, or recommend for consideration by the full Board of Directors, such candidate as a nominee for election to the Board of Directors.\n\nStrategy Committee\n\nThe Strategy Committee assists and advises in the strategic planning process for the Company and in developing long-term strategic plans for the Company. The Strategy Committee also evaluates strategic actions, including strategic investments, acquisitions, divestitures, financing strategies and assesses such actions for strategic alignment and short and long-term impact on the Company\u2019s objectives and stockholder value, among other things. The Strategy Committee reviews the Company\u2019s performance and progress with respect to the execution of its strategies and related impacts on the Company\u2019s objectives and stockholder value.\n\nDirector Attendance at Board Meetings and Annual Meetings of Stockholders\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Board of Directors of DZS held 14 meetings. Each director attended or participated in at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors on which he/she served, in each case during the period for which he/she was a director or a committee member. In addition to meetings, the Board of Directors and its committees sometimes took action by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting, which is permitted under Delaware corporate law.\n\nWe endeavor to schedule our annual meeting of stockholders at a time and date to maximize attendance by directors taking into account the directors\u2019 schedules. Three of our directors attended last year\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Role in Risk Oversight\n\nThe Board of Directors has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company\u2019s risks. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Audit Committee oversees management of financial risks and discusses our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee manages risks associated with the independence of the Board of Directors and potential conflicts of interest. The Strategy Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s business strategy and make recommendations to the Board on the Company\u2019s strategic direction and objectives.\n\nThe Board of Directors\u2019 role in our risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal and regulatory, and strategic and reputational risks. The full Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) receives these reports from the appropriate \u201crisk owner\u201d within the organization to enable it to understand our risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies. When a committee receives the report, the Chairman of the relevant committee reports on the discussion to the full Board of Directors during the committee reports portion of the next Board of Directors meeting. This enables the Board of Directors and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.\n\nCommunications with the Board of Directors\n\nAny stockholder wishing to communicate with any of our directors regarding corporate matters may write to the director, c/o Corporate Secretary, DZS Inc., 5700 Tennyson Parkway, Suite 400, Plano, Texas 75024. The Corporate Secretary will forward these communications directly to the director(s). However, certain correspondence such as spam, junk mail, mass mailings, product complaints or inquiries, job inquiries, surveys, business solicitations or advertisements, or patently offensive or otherwise inappropriate material may be forwarded elsewhere within the Company for review and possible response.\n\nInsider Trading Policy; No Hedging or Pledging\n\nDirectors, officers (including our NEOs) and employees must comply with our Insider Trading Policy and may not engage in any transaction in our securities without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from our Chief Legal Officer. We believe this plan is reasonably designed to promote compliance with the insider trading laws, rules and regulations, as well as the Nasdaq listing standards. No director, executive officer or other employee is permitted to (i) engage in short sales, transactions in put options, call options or other derivative securities on an exchange or in any other organized market, or in any other inherently speculative transactions with respect to our stock, (ii) transact through mechanisms that hedge against our securities, or (iii) hold our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging our securities as collateral for a loan.

        "question": "How's goodwill calculated in biz acquisitions?",
        "ground_truth": "Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.",
        "contexts": [
            ". Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If this assessment indicates that the cost of an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset\u2019s fair value.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rate, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n53\n\nAny assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.\n\n(m) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. In 2023, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date from October 31 to December 31. The Company believes this new date is preferable as it better aligns with the approval timeline for the Company\u2019s annual operating plan, which includes key inputs and assumptions used to assess the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n(n) Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\n\n(o) Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of restricted stock units based on the Company\u2019s stock price on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options, which is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the Company's expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. The expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. The expected term of options granted is determined based on SAB 107 simplified method. Risk- free interest rates reflect the yield on zero-coupon United States Treasury securities.\n\nThe Company amortizes the value of the stock-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method. The value of the award is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n\n(p) Income Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that"

Since, the delay due to above mentioned event was never envisaged by the Contractor, the Contractor is entitled for additional time with all the associated costs to complete the Work in all aspects, in accordance to the provisions of the Contract.\n\nDelay in handing-over/ shutting down the Units\n\nThe Contractor faced delays in start of Turn Around Works at units 2000, 5100, 5200, 5300, 5400, 5500, 5800, 6200, 6500, 6900, 3800 due to delay in shutting down and handing over to the Contractor.\n\nThe handing over of Units was planned on 04 November 2023, but, due to reasons not attributable to the Contractor, the handing over of these Units was delayed by 7 days to 11 November 2023.\n\nThe Employer vide email dated 31 October 2023 provided the Contractor with revised high-level schedule (R11) that incorporates the delays in the handover of units. This\n\n\n\ndemonstrates that the Employer is fully aware of the delays caused by the late handover of units, for which the Contractor bears no responsibility.\n\nThe Contractor on 18 January 2024 submitted to the Employer additional cost due to delayed hand over of units. The Contractor noted that the hand-over of units 2000, 5100, 5200, 5300, 5400, 5500, 5800, 6200, 6500, 6900, 3800 was delayed by 7 days by the Employer.\n\nThe delay in handover of Units by the Employer was due to emergent work in Sea water system that was not anticipated in Turn Around (TA) Schedule.\n\nThe Contractor claimed for additional costs incurred by the Contractor in maintaining Manpower, equipment, Flight tickets and Scaffolding for additional 7 days. The Contractor in total claimed for OMR 1,299,941.14 and requested the Employer to approve the additional cost.\n\nThe Employer on 31 July 2024 replied to Contractor\u2019s additional costs submission dated 18 January 2024 and rejected Contractor\u2019s claim. The Employer noted that the Contractor failed to notify the Employer within required time frame and emphasised the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to manage the resources and adopt to minor changes during the turnaround process.\n\nThe Employer noted that as per Clause 44.1 of Contract, the Contractor had to submit the notice within 28 days of the event. The Employer noted that, alleged delay event occurred on 04 November 2023 and the notification was due by 02 December 2023, and the Contractor failed to notify within required timeframe. The Employer also noted that the Contractor should have redeployed resources to other available units.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor on 18 August 2024 replied to Employer letter dated 31 July 2024 and disagreed with Employer\u2019s statements regarding the rejection of the Claim. The Contractor highlighted that the repair of 100\u201d GRE SWS line extended by more than 7 days, which the Contractor had no responsibility. The Contractor noted that the delay in repair had delayed the handing over of RFCC and Sea water system units. The Contractor emphasised that the delay had critically impacted the planned shutdown of SR1 plant and noted that the Employer did not adhere to Contract timelines for issuing instructions and approvals.\n\nThe Contractor asserted that the portion of resources remained idle due to 7-day delay and provide the details of idle resources. The Contractor requested the immediate relief for the financial burden caused by the delays and reserved all rights under the Contract and applicable law.\n\nThe Employer on 18 September 2024 replied to Contractor\u2019s letter dated 18 August 2024 and again informed its stand of rejection of Contractor additional cost claim. The Employer again noted that the Contractor failed to notify within 28-day timeframe as per clause 44.2 of Contract. The Employer stated that adequate work front was available to redeploy the resources. The Employer emphasised that there was no evidence of idle manpower and rejected the claim.\n\nThe Contractor on 21 October 2024, replied to Employer letters dated 18 September 2024 and clarified its position. The Contractor noted that the Contractor is seeking cost reimbursement due to a delayed handover of units by the Employer, which resulted in idle resources and significant operational impacts. The Contractor noted that the original shutdown of the SR1 plant was scheduled for 27 October 2023 but was delayed by the Employer until 03 November 2023, causing a 7-day delay in a compressed 32-day schedule. The Contractor noted that the Employer initially rejected the cost reimbursement claim, citing the delay as minor and referencing contractual notice requirements. However, the Contractor demonstrated that the Employer\u2019s own timelines",
            " for issuing critical instructions exceeded contractual limits.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor also noted that the Employer introduced alleged delays, penalties, and damages long after the successful completion of the turnaround (TA), which is an attempt to circumvent their legitimate cost reimbursement claim. The Contractor also emphasized that the Contractor had only claimed reimbursement for idle resource costs caused by the delayed handover and highlighted their significant acceleration efforts to minimize the schedule impact.\n\nThe Contractor further noted that it took considerable efforts to accelerate and mitigate the effects of constraints imposed by the Employer, including:\n\nLate issuance of call-off orders,\n\nDelayed handover of RFCC,\n\nLate material availability,\n\nDelays in retubing of exchangers,\n\nIncreased volume of refractory works and non-availability of refractory casting material,\n\nIncreased volume of SCF (Scope change form) Works,\n\nAdditional repair work directed by the Employer\n\nThe Contractor further reiterated its entitlement to compensation for idle resources and considerable acceleration efforts, including costs associated with additional manpower, equipment. The Contractor requested the Employer to engage in good faith to settle these legitimate claims and avoid further protraction of the matter. The Contractor also noted that it remains available to provide additional substantiation and work towards an equitable resolution, reserving all rights under the contract and law to protect their interests.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim and noted that the Contractor failed to submit a notice within 28 days after the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim,\n\n\n\nas required by Clause 44.1 of the Contract. The Employer also noted that the Contractor submitted almost eleven months after the events, leading to Employer\u2019s discharge from liability in connection with the claim.\n\nThe Employer replied to Contractor citations such as late issuance of call-off orders, delayed handover of RFCC, late material availability and pre-TA progress, delay in retubing of exchangers, increase in refractory works in regenerator, increased volume of SCF, SCF for repair of SCSP nozzle. \n\nThe Employer emphasised that the Contractor is not entitled to any additional payment due to its failure to provide timely notification. The Employer also noted that the comprehensive review of each claim submitted by the Contractor finds to be without merit. The Employer noted that it remains open to engaging with the Contractor to discuss the claims and any damages incurred due to the Contractor's poor performance.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim for additional payment due to idle time. The Employer noted that it does not intend to respond to each and every statement or allegation in the Contractor's letter dated 21 October 2024, particularly those unrelated to the idle time claim, such as matters of purported acceleration. Further, the Employer noted that failure to respond to any other statement or allegation in the referenced correspondence shall not be deemed as agreement or admission of the veracity, relevance, or acceptance of such statements or allegations.\n\nFrom the correspondences exchanged between the parties- \u2018Employer email dated 31 October 2023,\u2019 \u2018STS/PRP00140/002/2024 dated 18 January 2024,\u2019 \u2018STS/PRP00140/003/2024 dated 18 August 2024\u2019; and other communications- it is evident that the handover of the RFCC and Sea Water units was delayed by the Employer. This delay affected the overall turnaround and planned shutdown of the SR1-PP Plant. As a result, the Contractor's resources remained idle due to the delayed\n\n\n\nhandover of the units, which the Contractor had no responsibility and hence, the Contractor is entitled for additional costs incurred by the Contractor.\n\nAs per Clause 44 of conditions of Contract, the Contractor is entitled for Extension of Time for completion of Works. Since, the delay due to above mentioned event was never envisaged by the Contractor, the Contractor is entitled for additional time with all the associated costs to complete the Work in all aspects, in accordance to the provisions of the Contract.\n\nDelay in Pits and Valves works in Area 700\n\nThe execution of Works in Pits and Valves of Area 700 got delayed due to delay in handing over of 2 number Pit by the Employer.\n\nThe Contractor vide DPR 05 December 2023, 06 December 2023, 07 December 2023, 08 December 2023, 09 December 2023, 10 December 2023, 11 December 2023, 14 December 2023, 16 December 2023 and 17 December 2023 notified Employer.

Our DZS Velocity portfolio offers a variety of solutions for carriers and service providers to connect residential and enterprise customers, either using high-speed fiber or leveraging their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises. Once our broadband access products are deployed, the service provider can offer voice, ultra-high-definition video, high-speed internet access and business class services to their customers. In addition, the switching and routing products we provide in this space offer a high-performance and manageable solution that bridges the gap from carrier access technologies to the core network. DZS \u201csystem-on-a-card\u201d technology increases the velocity with which service providers can leap to multi-gigabit services at scale by enabling rapid transition from Gigabit Passive Optical Network (\u201cGPON\u201d) to 10 Gigabit Symmetrical Passive Optical Network (\u201cXGS-PON\u201d) and 50 Gigabit Passive Optical Network (\u201c50G PON\u201d) in the future and Gigabit Ethernet (\u201cGE\u201d) to 10 GE via any service port across a range of existing DZS Velocity chassis and 10 GE optimized stackable fixed form factor units.\n\n\n\nSubscriber Edge. Our DZS Helix connected premises product portfolio offers a large collection of optical network terminals (\u201cONTs\u201d) and smart gateway solutions for any fiber to the \u201cx\u201d (\u201cFTTx\u201d) deployment. DZS ONTs and Smart Gateway platforms are designed for high bandwidth services being deployed to the home or business. Our connected premises portfolio consists of indoor/outdoor ONTs and gateways delivering best-in-class data and WiFi throughout the premises to support FTTx applications. The product feature set gives service providers an elegant migration path from legacy voice to soft switch architectures without replacing ONTs.\n\n\n\nOptical Edge. Our DZS Chronos and DZS Saber portfolios provide robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile operators and service providers that enable them to modularly upgrade their edge transport to up to 400 gigabits per second (400 Gbps) speed as well as provide mobile fronthaul/midhaul/backhaul (\u201cxHaul\u201d) systems capable of supporting the transport needs for fifth generation wireless technologies (\u201c5G\u201d) and beyond. Our Saber solutions are 5G-ready xHaul and coherent optics capable and are open, software-defined, and field proven. Our mobile xHaul and edge transport products may be collocated at the radio access node base station and can aggregate multiple radio access node base stations into a single backhaul for delivery of mobile traffic to the radio access node network controller or be leveraged as transport vehicles for FTTx deployments. Our products support pure Ethernet switching as well as layer 3 IP and Multiprotocol Label Switching (\u201cMPLS\u201d), and we interoperate with other vendors in these networks. The Saber portfolio also provides high bandwidth optical transport and services, enabling service providers to push high bandwidth transport closer to their subscribers near the edge of their networks. Complementary to the growth of high bandwidth technologies like XGS-PON and 5G mobile at the access edge, Saber products leverage environmentally hardened dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) coherent optics to deliver transport bandwidth speeds from 100 Gbps to 400 Gbps over long distances that can be necessary to support advanced access and mobile technologies. Some DZS Saber platforms also provide additional feature such as multi-degree colorless directionless contentionless (CDC) FlexGrid reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) functionality, which allows service providers",

(referred to, collectively with its subsidiaries, as \u201cDZS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global provider of access and optical networking infrastructure and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven cloud software solutions that enable the emerging hyper-connected, hyper-broadband world and broadband experiences. The Company provides a wide array of reliable, cost-effective networking technologies and cloud software to a diverse customer base.\n\nDZS was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 1999. The Company is headquartered in Plano, Texas with contract manufacturers located in the U.S., China, India, and Korea. The Company maintains offices to provide sales and customer support at global locations. Through 2022, we have also used our manufacturing facility in Seminole, Florida. In October 2022, we announced an agreement with Fabrinet, a third-party provider of electromechanical and electronic manufacturing and distribution services, to transition the sourcing, procurement, order-fulfillment, manufacturing and return merchandise authorization activities in the Company's Seminole facility to Fabrinet. The transition began in October 2022 and substantially completed in the beginning of 2023, whereupon the Company no longer manufactures its products.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company completed a divestiture of certain subsidiaries in Asia (the \"Asia Sale\"). The divestiture allows DZS to focus on the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Australia/New Zealand (ANZ) regions that are strategically aligned with the technology and acquisition investments made over the past several years.\n\n(b) Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 3 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete",
            " financial statements. These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) on August 13, 2024. For a complete description of what the Company believes to be the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nOperating results of subsidiaries divested in conjunction with the Asia Sale were classified as discontinued operations in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for all periods presented. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale of the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\n\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the current interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the current year or any other period.\n\n(c) Risks and Uncertainties\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.\n\nWe continue to be exposed to macroeconomic pressures in the post-COVID-19 environment, including concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment. We have seen improvement in our supply chain in 2024 as supply chain pricing, freight and logistics costs, product and component availability, and extended lead-times which were a challenge in prior years begin to alleviate. We expect elevated costs for components and expedite fees to further improve throughout 2024.\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(d) Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n\n(e) Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nThe following table presents revenues by product technology (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nAccess Networking Infrastructure Cloud Software & Services\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n20,232 $ 7,435 27,667 $\n\nThe following table present revenues by geographical concentration (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nAmericas Europe, Middle East, Africa Asia\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n15,957 $ 10,823 887 27,667 $\n\n(f) Concentration of Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, and contract assets. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of financial deposits and money market accounts that are principally held with various domestic and international financial institutions with high credit standing. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash accounts in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insured limits.\n\nThe Company\u2019s customers include competitive and incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive access providers, internet service providers, wireless carriers and resellers serving these markets. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Allowances are maintained for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable using historical loss rates adjusted for customer- specific factors and current economic conditions. The Company determines historical loss rates on a rational and systematic basis. The Company performs periodic assessments of its customers\u2019 liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies, financial statement review and historical and current collection trends.\n\nActivity under the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses consists of the following (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nBalance at beginning of period Charged to expense, net of recoveries Foreign currency exchange impact\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n$\n\n$\n\n4,282 $ (161) (11) 4,110 $\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 13% of net revenue.

            " Company\u2019s consolidated gross deferred tax assets balance was $76.4 million before a valuation allowance of $74.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nWe identified the deferred tax assets valuation allowance as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination is the significant judgement involved in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. Auditing these elements involved especially subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address these matters.\n\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n\n\n\nEvaluating the company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, including management\u2019s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to utilize the net deferred tax assets.\n\n\n\nEvaluating the assessment of the reversals of the existing temporary differences and the proper application of the tax laws.\n\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.

These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) on August 13, 2024. For a complete description of what the Company believes to be the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nOperating results of subsidiaries divested in conjunction with the Asia Sale were classified as discontinued operations in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for all periods presented. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale of the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\n\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the current interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the current year or any other period.\n\n(c) Risks and Uncertainties\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.\n\nWe continue to be exposed to macroeconomic pressures in the post-COVID-19 environment, including concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment. We have seen improvement in our supply chain in 2024 as supply chain pricing, freight and logistics costs, product and component availability, and extended lead-times which were a challenge in prior years begin to alleviate. We expect elevated costs for components and expedite fees to further improve throughout 2024.\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(d) Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n\n(e) Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nThe following table presents revenues by product technology (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nAccess Networking Infrastructure Cloud Software & Services\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n20,232 $ 7,435 27,667 $\n\nThe following table present revenues by geographical concentration (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nAmericas Europe, Middle East, Africa Asia\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n15,957 $ 10,823 887 27,667 $\n\n(f) Concentration of Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, and contract assets. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of financial deposits and money market accounts that are principally held with various domestic and international financial institutions with high credit standing. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash accounts in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insured limits.\n\nThe Company\u2019s customers include competitive and incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive access providers, internet service providers, wireless carriers and resellers serving these markets. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Allowances are maintained for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable using historical loss rates adjusted for customer- specific factors and current economic conditions. The Company determines historical loss rates on a rational and systematic basis. The Company performs periodic assessments of its customers\u2019 liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies, financial statement review and historical and current collection trends.\n\nActivity under the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses consists of the following (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nBalance at beginning of period Charged to expense, net of recoveries Foreign currency exchange impact\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n$\n\n$\n\n4,282 $ (161) (11) 4,110 $\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 13% of net revenue.

        "question": "What happens if an asset's value exceeds future cash flows?",
        "ground_truth": "If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.",
        "contexts": [
            ". Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If this assessment indicates that the cost of an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset\u2019s fair value.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rate, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n53\n\nAny assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.\n\n(m) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. In 2023, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date from October 31 to December 31. The Company believes this new date is preferable as it better aligns with the approval timeline for the Company\u2019s annual operating plan, which includes key inputs and assumptions used to assess the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n(n) Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\n\n(o) Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of restricted stock units based on the Company\u2019s stock price on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options, which is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the Company's expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. The expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. The expected term of options granted is determined based on SAB 107 simplified method. Risk- free interest rates reflect the yield on zero-coupon United States Treasury securities.\n\nThe Company amortizes the value of the stock-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method. The value of the award is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n\n(p) Income Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that"

These variables include the Company\u2019s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The estimated expected term of options granted was determined based on SAB 107 simplified method because the Company does not have adequate historical data for newly issued stock options. Estimated volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company and the risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for the expected life of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nThe Company did not grant any stock options during the year ended December 31, 2023.
