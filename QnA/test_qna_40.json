Company reverted with its comments only on 18th Oct 22 that is after 30 days from permit application. This is clear evidence that the delays are attributable to the company. Further, inline to the company comments, contractor have shared the supporting documents on 24th Oct 22 and Permit is still open with company till date, adding on to the delays.\n\nCompany comments against contractor request of Clearance for the HV cable rerouting is not valid. Although the permit approved on 26th Sep 22 for excavation, clearance from company received only by 9th Oct 22 and excavation completed on 10th Nov 22. With regards to the relaying of cables, contractor is still waiting for clearance and following up on weekly interface Meetings for the clearance. Company listed activities in the letter are sequential activities followed by pre-commissioning MST approvals and laying of cables. Company intent of listing these activities in this letter is not relevant to the context and also not clear to the contractor. However Contractor would like to record here that Asset sign off process is not part of contractor scope and these were not informed to contractor during schedule development. Company is requested to comply with clause 6 biz 2(d) of section B1 GCC \u201cContractor shall plan for a minimum of 2 Review/Approval cycles for each submitted document. Each review cycle shall last for ten (10) Business days from receipt, calculated from date on which company receives a contractor\u2019s document\u201d.\n\nCompany alleged comments are not acceptable. These requirement have been discussed with company representative on daily and weekly basis since the date of request. Contractor requested once again company to share the details as soon as possible to avoid further delays.\n\nCompany\u2019s statement on contractor late request for communication check is not correct and unsubstantiated, hence Contractor disagrees with company\u2019s views. Company to note that the significant delays from company side due to the lack of approval process and scope management impacted the contractor works significantly and resulted in time and cost implications. These delays and corresponding impacts are well presented by contractor through interim EOT.\n\nHence, Contractor claim pursuant to clause 31 biz 1(A) of section-B1 General conditions of contract remains valid and contractor reserves all its right under contract and at Law\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nFor Zawawi Powertech Engineering LLC,\n\nKrishnaraj Bonagiri Project Director"
