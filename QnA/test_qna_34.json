Under the Settlement Agreement,2 Contractor made substantial financial concessions to Subcontractor amounting to USD 12.7 million, including:\n\na) An additional cash payment of USD 5.7 million to Subcontractor; and\n\nb) A waiver of back charges amounting to USD 7 million, which had previously been imposed due to Subcontractor's demonstrated shortcomings in manpower provision and overall project performance as recorded in Project Correspondences.\n\nIn consideration of these concessions, Subcontractor unequivocally agreed to complete all balance works under the Subcontract mobilizing its own resources, allowing Contractor to withdraw previously injected resources to cease any further additional cost; this was at the heart of the Agreement, and provided Subcontractor an opportunity to address prior deficiencies and fulfill its outstanding contractual obligations in a timely and efficient manner.\n\nIt is a matter of fact that Subcontractor has failed to honour its commitments, and has exhibited a lack of effort and diligence to inject additional resources to attend all scope, in contravention of the principles of good faith embedded in the Agreement. Subcontractor's continued underperformance necessitated substantial remedial action by Contractor to keep previously injected resources on part of Subcontractor\u2019s scope, at additional unforeseen costs to it, including maintaining additional injected manpower and equipment (post settlement agreement) to complete the balance works that Subcontractor was obligated to perform.\n\n2. Contractor disagrees with Subcontractor\u2019s assertion that \"Contractor intentionally delayed the finalization of SA1 to account for its own delay in providing the necessary work front\", since facts on record demonstrate that it was Subcontractor who caused the delays.\n\nSubcontractor\u2019s persistent refusal to aline its schedule with the Project requirements directly delayed in finalizing SA1; notwithstanding this, Contractor sent the draft SA1 with\n\n1 no. TWE-PCS-L-1007-00230 dated 27 January 2025 2 dated 30-April-2022\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\nA joint venture between Petrofac International Ltd. and Samsung Engineering Co. Ltd.\n\nthe Subcontractor for review on 4 June 2022.3 Even as late as 21 August 2022, SA1 remained unsigned by Subcontractor. During this period, despite multiple formal requests, Subcontractor also failed to submit the final schedule.4\n\n3. Subcontractor\u2019s statement that \u2018Subcontractor completed the Subcontract Works (balance scope post the descope by the Contractor) substantially by October 2022, in compliance with SA1 extension\u201d in December 2022 due to Contractor\u2019s intervention, which Subcontractor has failed to admit. Contractor refutes Subcontractor\u2019s assertion that the back charges pertain to issues predating the effective date of SA1. They correspond to costs incurred after the effective date of SA1, and Contractor has, in fact, waived a substantial portion of incurred costs, which is until 30 April 2022. The costs incurred thereafter due to Subcontractor\u2019s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations devolve solely on Subcontractor. Contractor\u2019s letters PCS- TWE-L-1007-00298 and 00345 dated 25 April 2022 and 1 August 2022 respectively demonstrate the factual and contractual basis of its claims.\n\n4. Subcontractor\u2019s contention that \u201cThe SA1 was executed on 12 November 2022, and up until that date, the Contractor did not raise any claims regarding additional back charges incurred after affective date\u2019 is false. The effective date of SA1 was 30 April 2022, whereas Contractor has officially communicated to Subcontractor through different communication as shown in Table 1 which excludes emails and minutes of meeting.\n\nDate\n\nLetter Number\n\n",

Box 307, PC-118 Al-Harthy Complex Muscat, Sultanate of Oman\n\nAttention: Mr. Jayasankar M, GM TA&M\n\nContract: Contract No.4600007104 Call-Off Contract for Main Mechanical Works during\n\nTurnaround for Downstream Assets\n\nSubject: Contractor Purported Acceleration\n\nOQ refers to the Contract No.4600007104 Call-Off Contract for Main Mechanical Works during Turnaround for Downstream Assets, and related Call-Off Orders issued pertaining to mechanical works for Turn Around (TA) at Sohar Refinery (SR1) & Polypropylene Plant (PP), and the Contractor\u2019s Reference Letter No. STS/PRP00140/ 004/2024a dated 21 October 2024.\n\nAs per Clause 44.1 in C3 of the Contract, if the Contractor considers itself to be entitled to any adjustment to the Contract Price, the Contractor shall submit a notice as soon as practicable and, in any event, not later than twenty-eight (28) days after the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim. On 21 October 2024, almost eleven (11) months later after the events stated in the section D and E of the Contractor\u2019s reference letter, the Contractor asserted that they believe in that they are entitled to compensation for their purported acceleration to mitigate so-called OQ\u2019s delays. The Contractor failed to notify within 28 days after the event and the Contractor shall not be entitled to any additional payment and OQ shall be discharged from all liability in connection with the claim in accordance with Clause 44.2 in C3 of the Contract. Therefore, the Contractor\u2019s claim for additional payment for acceleration is rejected.\n\nWithout prejudice to above, the Company would like to provide their comments to the events stated in Section E of the Contractor\u2019s letter in the same sequence. However, The Company does not intend to respond each and every statement or allegation in the Contractor\u2019s reference letter. Company\u2019s failure to respond or address any other statement or allegation in referenced correspondence shall not be deemed, implied or construed as its agreement or admission by the Company of the veracity, relevance or acceptance, of such statement or allegation, and the Company reserves its right to respond thereto at a later date and at or in the appropriate forum.\n\n1. Late Issuance of Call-Off Order related to the Scope Change Form (\u201cSCF\u201d) SCF means \u201cany scope discovered during TA execution and after equipment opening\u201d. The Company has a right to instruct the Contractor to execute SCF or any additional work authorized by OQ TA Manager during TA Execution, in accordance with clause 39 of C3 and section 6 of C4 of the Contract.\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\nThe Contractor is required to prepare and submit the costing of SCF, and all changes are to be documented through an approved SCF which shall then be followed by an approved Call-Off Order in accordance with Sections 6.1.1.3 and 6.1.2.1 of C4 of the Contract.\n\nThe Company has issued all instructions and SCF\u2019s in an appropriate manner for the Contractor to progress with the works. Therefore, there was neither a delay arising out of this process nor any acceleration by the Contractor as alleged.\n\n2. Delayed Handover of RFCC This issue was in the Contractor\u2019s idle time claim and repeated here. It was duly addressed by the Company in its relevant letters. The Company notes a contradiction in the Contractor\u2019s assertion that it kept 2,160 man idle over a full duration of seven days with no mitigation in the Contractor\u2019s idle time claim, while also asserting that the Contractor accommodated the seven-day impact in its acceleration claim. 3 and 4. Late Material Availability & Pre-TA Progress Company\u2019s records indicate that all materials listed in the original MTO were delivered between February and October 2023. The Company reminds that it was the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to validate and verify the original MTO to identify any possible missing materials and report to OQ at least four months prior to TA execution.

Box 307, PC-118 Al-Harthy Complex Muscat, Sultanate of Oman\n\nAttention: Mr. Jayasankar M, GM TA&M\n\nContract: Contract No.4600007104 Call-Off Contract for Main Mechanical Works during\n\nTurnaround for Downstream Assets\n\nSubject: Contractor Purported Acceleration\n\nOQ refers to the Contract No.4600007104 Call-Off Contract for Main Mechanical Works during Turnaround for Downstream Assets, and related Call-Off Orders issued pertaining to mechanical works for Turn Around (TA) at Sohar Refinery (SR1) & Polypropylene Plant (PP), and the Contractor\u2019s Reference Letter No. STS/PRP00140/ 004/2024a dated 21 October 2024.\n\nAs per Clause 44.1 in C3 of the Contract, if the Contractor considers itself to be entitled to any adjustment to the Contract Price, the Contractor shall submit a notice as soon as practicable and, in any event, not later than twenty-eight (28) days after the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim. On 21 October 2024, almost eleven (11) months later after the events stated in the section D and E of the Contractor\u2019s reference letter, the Contractor asserted that they believe in that they are entitled to compensation for their purported acceleration to mitigate so-called OQ\u2019s delays. The Contractor failed to notify within 28 days after the event and the Contractor shall not be entitled to any additional payment and OQ shall be discharged from all liability in connection with the claim in accordance with Clause 44.2 in C3 of the Contract. Therefore, the Contractor\u2019s claim for additional payment for acceleration is rejected.\n\nWithout prejudice to above, the Company would like to provide their comments to the events stated in Section E of the Contractor\u2019s letter in the same sequence. However, The Company does not intend to respond each and every statement or allegation in the Contractor\u2019s reference letter. Company\u2019s failure to respond or address any other statement or allegation in referenced correspondence shall not be deemed, implied or construed as its agreement or admission by the Company of the veracity, relevance or acceptance, of such statement or allegation, and the Company reserves its right to respond thereto at a later date and at or in the appropriate forum.\n\n1. Late Issuance of Call-Off Order related to the Scope Change Form (\u201cSCF\u201d) SCF means \u201cany scope discovered during TA execution and after equipment opening\u201d. The Company has a right to instruct the Contractor to execute SCF or any additional work authorized by OQ TA Manager during TA Execution, in accordance with clause 39 of C3 and section 6 of C4 of the Contract.\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\nThe Contractor is required to prepare and submit the costing of SCF, and all changes are to be documented through an approved SCF which shall then be followed by an approved Call-Off Order in accordance with Sections 6.1.1.3 and 6.1.2.1 of C4 of the Contract.\n\nThe Company has issued all instructions and SCF\u2019s in an appropriate manner for the Contractor to progress with the works. Therefore, there was neither a delay arising out of this process nor any acceleration by the Contractor as alleged.\n\n2. Delayed Handover of RFCC This issue was in the Contractor\u2019s idle time claim and repeated here. It was duly addressed by the Company in its relevant letters. The Company notes a contradiction in the Contractor\u2019s assertion that it kept 2,160 man idle over a full duration of seven days with no mitigation in the Contractor\u2019s idle time claim, while also asserting that the Contractor accommodated the seven-day impact in its acceleration claim. 3 and 4. Late Material Availability & Pre-TA Progress Company\u2019s records indicate that all materials listed in the original MTO were delivered between February and October 2023. The Company reminds that it was the Contractor\u2019s responsibility to validate and verify the original MTO to identify any possible missing materials and report to OQ at least four months prior to TA execution. The Contractor delayed MTO validation by one month. The Company took immediate actions to order missing materials in the original MTO and additional materials requested to reduce the field joints. Therefore, the Contractor\u2019s alleged delayed materials in its reference letter should be the materials which was delayed due to Contractor\u2019s own MTO validation delay.\n\nWhile the Contractor reported general concerns regarding"
