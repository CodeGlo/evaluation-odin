        "ground_truth": "In August 2024, the 2019 Tower preferred interests were amended, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests. All of the 2019 Tower preferred interests were designated as Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests).

            " of AT&T common stock to settle put and redemption options.\n\nOn October 24, 2022, approximately 105 million Mobility preferred interests were put to AT&T by a third-party investor, for which we paid approximately $2,600 cash to redeem. On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining 213 million, or approximately $5,340, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately 107 million shares, or $2,670. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current liabilities as \u201cAccounts payable and\n\n83\n\nAT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts\n\naccrued liabilities,\u201d representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $2,670 recorded in \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities.\u201d The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\nTower Holdings Preferred Interests In 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the \u201c2019 Tower preferred interests\u201d). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fixed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the \u201cTower preferred interests\u201d) would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in \u201cNoncontrolling interest\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\nTelco LLC Preferred Interests In September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an"

            " charge imposed on the U.S. government obligations we deposited with the\n\ntrustee or against the principal and interest received on these obligations.\n\nLiens on Assets\n\nThe Indenture does not restrict us from pledging or otherwise encumbering any of our assets and those of our subsidiaries.\n\nDefault and Related Matters\n\nRanking Compared to Other Creditors\n\nThe securities are not secured by any of our property or assets. Accordingly, ownership of securities means each holder is one of our unsecured\n\ncreditors. The securities are not subordinated to any of our other debt obligations and therefore they rank equally with all our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. However, the trustee has a right to receive payment for its administrative services prior to any payment to security holders after a default.\n\nEvents of Default\n\nHolders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured, as described later in this subsection.\n\nWhat Is an Event of Default? The term \u201cevent of default\u201d with respect to any series of securities means any of the following:\n\nWe fail to make any interest payment on the securities of such series when it is due, and we do not cure this default within 90 days. \u2022 We fail to make any payment of principal when it is due at the maturity of such series of securities or upon redemption. \u2022 We fail to comply with any of our other agreements regarding a particular series of securities or with a supplemental indenture, and after we have been notified of the default by the trustee or holders of 25% in principal amount of the series, we do not cure the default within 90 days.\n\nWe file for bankruptcy, or other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.\n\nRemedies if an Event of Default Occurs\n\nHolders and the trustee will have the following remedies if an event of default occurs:\n\nAcceleration. If an event of default has occurred and has not been cured or waived, then the trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of\n\nthe securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of and any accrued interest on all the securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. An acceleration of maturity may be cancelled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the securities of the affected series, if all events of default have been cured or waived.\n\nSpecial Duties of Trustee. If an event of default occurs, the trustee will have some special duties. In that situation, the trustee will be obligated to\n\nuse those of its rights and powers under the Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in doing so, that a prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or her own affairs.\n\nOther Remedies of Trustee. If an event of default occurs, the trustee is authorized to pursue any available remedy to collect defaulted principal and\n\ninterest and to enforce other provisions of the securities and the Indenture, including bringing a lawsuit.\n\nMajority Holders May Direct the Trustee to Take Actions to Protect Their Interests. The trustee is not required to take any action under the Indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability. This is called an \u201cindemnity\u201d. If the trustee is provided with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other action under the Indenture.\n\nIndividual Actions Holders May Take if the Trustee Fails to Act. Before a holder bypasses the trustee and bring such holder\u2019s own lawsuit or other\n\nformal legal action or take other steps to enforce such holder\u2019s rights or protect such holder\u2019s interests relating to the securities, the following must occur:\n\n\u2022\n\nSuch holder must give the trustee written notice that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured. The holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding securities of the relevant series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and must offer indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action. The trustee must not have taken action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity.\n\n\u2022 During the 60-day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the securities of that series do not give the trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.\n\nHowever, a holder is entitled at any time to bring an individual lawsuit for the payment of the money due on such holder\u2019s security on or after its\n\ndue date.\n\nWaiver of Default\n\nThe",
            " holders of a majority in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities may waive a default for all the relevant series of debt\n\nsecurities. If this happens, the default will be treated as if it had not occurred. No one can waive a payment default on a holder\u2019s debt security, however, without such holder\u2019s individual approval.\n\nWe Will Give the Trustee Information About Defaults Annually\n\nEvery year we will give to the trustee a written statement of one of our officers certifying that to the best of his or her knowledge we are in\n\ncompliance with the Indenture and all the securities under it, or else specifying any default.\n\nThe trustee may withhold from holders notice of any uncured default, except for payment defaults, if it determines that withholding notice is in\n\nholders\u2019 interest.\n\nHolders who hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the trustee and how to make or cancel a declaration of acceleration.\n\nRegarding the Trustee\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee under the Indenture. In addition, affiliates of The Bank of New York Mellon may perform various\n\ncommercial banking and investment banking services for us and our subsidiaries from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE 4.250% GLOBAL NOTES DUE 2043\n\nThe following summary of AT&T\u2019s above referenced debt securities is based on and qualified by the indenture, dated as of May 15, 2013, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., acting as trustee (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the 4.250% Global Notes due 2043 (the \u201cNotes\u201d).

The Notes constitute a single series under the Indenture. The Notes are issued in fully registered form only and in minimum denominations of \u00a3100,000 and integral multiples of \u00a31,000 in excess thereof. Principal and interest payments on the Notes are payable by us in pound sterling. Payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the Notes will be made to Euroclear System, Clearstream Banking S.A. or such nominee or common depositary, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. Under the terms of the Indenture, if the pound sterling ceases to exist when payments on the Notes are due under any circumstances, AT&T may supplement the Indenture to allow for payment in U.S. dollars. The principal and interest payable in U.S. dollars on a Note at maturity, or upon redemption, will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds against presentation of a Note at the office of the paying agent.\n\nFor purposes of the Notes, a business day means a business day in the City of New York and London.\n\nInterest\n\nThe Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.250% per annum.\n\nWe pay interest on the Notes annually in arrears on June 1, commencing on June 1, 2014, to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered\n\nat the close of business on the May 15 preceding the interest payment date.\n\nThe Notes will mature on June 1, 2043.\n\nInterest on the Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual\n\nnumber of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes, to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date.

        "ground_truth": "Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be AT&T's principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches.

            " of accounts receivable based on past experience, taking into account current collection trends and general economic factors, including bankruptcy rates. We also consider future economic trends to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Credit risks are assessed based on historical write-offs, net of recoveries, as well as an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with allowances generally increasing as the receivable ages. Accounts receivable may be fully reserved for when specific collection issues are known to exist, such as catastrophes or pending bankruptcies.\n\nInventories Inventories primarily consist of wireless devices and accessories and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, except for assets acquired through business combinations, which are initially recorded at fair value. The cost of additions and substantial improvements to property, plant and equipment is capitalized, and includes internal compensation costs for these projects. The cost of maintenance and repairs of property, plant and equipment is charged to operating expenses. Property, plant and equipment costs are depreciated using straight-line methods over their estimated economic lives. Certain subsidiaries follow composite group depreciation methodology. Accordingly, when a portion of their depreciable property, plant and equipment is retired in the ordinary course of business, the gross book value is reclassified to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of these assets.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. (See Note 7)\n\nThe liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize period-to-period changes in the\n\n48\n\nAT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts\n\nliability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. The increase in the carrying value of the associated long-lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life.\n\nSoftware Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are included in \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment \u2013 Net\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a three-year to seven-year period, reflecting the estimated period during which these assets will remain in service.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets We have the following major classes of intangible assets: goodwill; licenses, which include Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; customer lists and relationships; and trademarks, trade names and various other finite- lived intangible assets (see Note 9).\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nWireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communications services. While wireless licenses are issued for a fixed period of time (generally ten years), renewals of domestic wireless licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. We have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wireless licenses. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in \u201cAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\u201d in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use.\n\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their average remaining economic life of 25 years.\n\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&T and other trade names in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of those trade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effective ability to retain these exclusive rights permanently at a nominal cost.\n\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing is performed on the value as of October 1 each year and compares the book values of the assets to their fair values. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested on an aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenses on a national scope, using a discounted cash flow approach. Trade names are tested by comparing their book values to their fair values calculated"

            ", we cannot discharge ourselves from the obligations under any convertible or exchangeable securities, unless we provide for it in the\n\nterms of these securities.\n\nIf we accomplish full discharge, as described above, holders will have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the securities. Holders could not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall. Conversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent.\n\nWe will indemnify the trustee and holders against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on the U.S. government obligations we deposited with the\n\ntrustee or against the principal and interest received on these obligations.\n\nLiens on Assets\n\nThe Indenture does not restrict us from pledging or otherwise encumbering any of our assets and those of our subsidiaries.\n\nDefault and Related Matters\n\nRanking Compared to Other Creditors\n\nThe securities are not secured by any of our property or assets. Accordingly, ownership of securities means each holder is one of our unsecured\n\ncreditors. The securities are not subordinated to any of our other debt obligations and therefore they rank equally with all our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. However, the trustee has a right to receive payment for its administrative services prior to any payment to security holders after a default.\n\nEvents of Default\n\nHolders will have special rights if an event of default occurs and is not cured, as described later in this subsection.\n\nWhat Is an Event of Default? The term \u201cevent of default\u201d with respect to any series of securities means any of the following:\n\nWe fail to make any interest payment on the securities of such series when it is due, and we do not cure this default within 90 days.\n\nWe fail to make any payment of principal when it is due at the maturity of such series of securities or upon redemption.\n\nWe fail to comply with any of our other agreements regarding a particular series of securities or with a supplemental indenture, and after we have been notified of the default by the trustee or holders of 25% in principal amount of the series, we do not cure the default within 90 days.\n\nWe file for bankruptcy, or other events in bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur.\n\nRemedies if an Event of Default Occurs\n\nHolders and the trustee will have the following remedies if an event of default occurs:\n\nAcceleration. If an event of default has occurred and has not been cured or waived, then the trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of\n\nthe securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of and any accrued interest on all the securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. An acceleration of maturity may be cancelled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the securities of the affected series, if all events of default have been cured or waived.\n\nSpecial Duties of Trustee. If an event of default occurs, the trustee will have some special duties. In that situation, the trustee will be obligated to\n\nuse those of its rights and powers under the Indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in doing so, that a prudent person would use in that situation in conducting his or her own affairs.\n\nOther Remedies of Trustee. If an event of default occurs, the trustee is authorized to pursue any available remedy to collect defaulted principal and\n\ninterest and to enforce other provisions of the securities and the Indenture, including bringing a lawsuit.\n\nMajority Holders May Direct the Trustee to Take Actions to Protect Their Interests. The trustee is not required to take any action under the Indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable protection from expenses and liability. This is called an \u201cindemnity\u201d. If the trustee is provided with an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal legal action seeking any remedy available to the trustee. These majority holders may also direct the trustee in performing any other action under the Indenture.\n\nIndividual Actions Holders May Take if the Trustee Fails to Act. Before a holder bypasses the trustee and brings such holder\u2019s own lawsuit or other\n\nformal legal action or take other steps to enforce such holder\u2019s rights or protect such holder\u2019s interests relating to the securities, the following must occur:\n\nSuch holder must give the trustee written notice that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured.\n\nThe holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding securities of the relevant series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and must offer indemnity reasonably satisfactory",

An increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as their primary means of viewing video. In addition, businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wireless-based services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies. We have spent, and continue to spend, significant capital to shift our wired network to software-based technology and are expanding 5G wireless technology to address these demands. We are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in wireless demand. While software-based functionality can be changed much more quickly than, for example, physical switches, the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on single-source and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments. Should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims, we could be forced to either substitute (if available) or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability, and, as a result, our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe depend on various suppliers to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy",

These competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Additionally, we may not be able to accurately predict future consumer demands or the success of new services in markets. Our ability to address these issues will depend, among other things, on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services. These efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and service offerings.

        "question": "How did the Contractor's DPRs and extra resources at SR1 and PP help address delays and support cost claims?",
        "ground_truth": "The Contractor's Daily Progress Reports (DPRs) and the mobilization of extra resources, such as additional manpower and equipment, helped address delays by documenting the issues and hindrances impacting the project. These reports provided details of planned and actual manpower and equipment at the site, demonstrating the increase in resources due to acceleration measures. This substantiation supported the Contractor's claims for additional costs incurred due to the delays caused by the Employer, as the Contractor was able to show the necessity of these measures to mitigate the delays and achieve the project completion date.",
        "contexts": [
            " from the Employer's actions in delaying the commencement of works. By applying the principles of delay and critical path analysis, as well as basic common sense, it is unequivocally clear that these delays are attributable to the Employer.\n\nThe Employer\u2019s assertions regarding Contractor delays and default are entirely without merit, unsupported by any credible evidence, and devoid of a comprehensive assessment of the critical delays. As such, these claims are baseless and is dismissed as untenable. \n\nThe Contractor is entitled to an Extension of Time (EOT) for the completion of the Works, pursuant to Clause 44 of the Contract, as well as compensation for the additional costs incurred due to these delays.\n\nHence, the Contractor again reiterate and requests the Employer assess its claim for OMR 1,299,941.14 towards additional costs due to delayed hand over of units.\n\nAcceleration costs\n\nWhat is Acceleration?\n\nIf the Contractor is prevented from following what was its reasonable plan at the time of entering the Contract for carrying out the Works or a part of them (i.e., disturbance, hindrance or interruption to the Contractor\u2019s normal Working hours or the Works were\n\n\n\ndisrupted), the likelihood is that the Contractor resources will accomplish lower productivity or efficiency than Planned on the impacted Work activities, such that overall, those Work activities will cost more to complete.\n\nHence, the Work that is carried with a lower than reasonably anticipated Productivity rate (i.e., which is disrupted) will lead to\n\nActivity delay\n\nThe need for acceleration, such as increasing resources, work faces or working hours, to avoid activity delay\n\nOr combination of both\n\nDelay and Disruption are inherently interrelated. A loss in Productivity (i.e., disruption) can lead to delay and, if the impacted activities are on critical path, that can be a critical delay.\n\nIt is possible for work to be disrupted and yet to be completed by the contract completion date. In this situation, the Contractor will not have claim for EOT, but it may have a claim for the cost of the lost productivity.\n\nEqually, delay can lead to disruption. If the Contractor has less time to carry out the work activities (absent an EOT for the critical path activities), it is possible that acceleration measures implemented will lead to those tasks being carried out with lower productivity than planned and hence at greater cost.\n\nAcceleration Measures taken by the Contractor\n\nDuring the execution of the Project, the Contractor encountered multiple delays that were Employer delay events and not attributable to the Contractor.\n\nThese delays collectively impacted the Project completion date and created the risk of missing the agreed completion date. The Contractor under clause 4.3.8.2.4 of Scope of Work notified the Employer regarding the \u2018Major issues and areas of concerns\u2019 in the Daily Progress reports.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor took remedial measures to maintain the Progress of Works and reduce the impact of these delays. The Contractor implemented additional measures (i.e., acceleration measures) to reduce the impact of delays and such measures include mobilization of additional Manpower and Equipment.\n\nThe Contractor in delay report assessed the impact of Employer delays and accordingly, the estimated/ impacted completion of the Project was 12 January 2024. However, through the additional efforts and acceleration measures of the Contractor, the Mechanical Works in SR1-PP were successfully completed on 19 December 2024.\n\nThese additional measures taken to accelerate the Works has resulted in significant additional costs to the Contractor.\n\nThe clause 15.1 of General conditions of the Contract states that:\n\n\u201cThe Contractor shall notify Company in writing immediately it becomes aware of any circumstance or event which is likely to cause delay in the performance of the Services and shall take all reasonable measures to mitigate such delay at no additional cost to Company. Where the delay is the responsibility of Company, Company shall compensate the Contractor for the reasonable costs of such remedial measures as Company instructs the Contractor to take. Such compensation shall be subject to such substantiation of the Contractor's costs as Company may reasonably require and, to the extent possible, be calculated in accordance with the Rates.\u201d \n\nThe Contractor under clause 15.1 of General conditions of the Contract is entitled to additional costs for such remedial measures taken on proper substantiation to the Employer/ Company.\n\nIt can be noted that the Contractor through Daily Progress report timely notified the Employer regarding the major issues and hindrances that are impacting the Project.\n\nThe Contractor under Delay report substantiated that the Employer delays in the Project jeopardized the completion date of the Mechanical Works. Hadn\u2019t the Contractor proceeded with these acceleration measures such as mobilizing the additional manpower and equipment, the Mechanical Works would have completed on 12 January 2024.",
            "\n\n\n\nThe acceleration measures taken by the Contractor resulted in successful completion of Mechanical Works as of 19 December 2023, i.e., reducing the impact of completion from 12 January 2024 to 19 December 2023.\n\nMobilizing additional Manpower and Equipment\n\nManpower:\n\nAs stated above, the Contractor mobilized additional Manpower and Equipment to reduce the impact of Employer delays.\n\nThe Contractor in the Daily Progress reports (DPR\u2019s) submitted to Employer, provided the details of Planned and Actual Manpower present at Site. The details are analysed and are as follows:\n\nCALL-OFF CONTRACT FOR MAIN MECHANICAL WORKS DURING TURNAROUND\nContractor\u2019s Comprehensive Submission for Cost claim\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graph-Planned vs Actual Manpower\n\nCALL-OFF CONTRACT FOR MAIN MECHANICAL WORKS DURING TURNAROUND\nContractor\u2019s Comprehensive Submission for Cost claim\n\n\n\nThe details of Planned Manpower have been taken from the DPR\u2019s for the period from 04 November 2023 to 09 December 2023, while the details of Actual Manpower have been taken from the DPRs for the period from 04 November 2023 to 18 December 2023.\n\nThe above graph clearly demonstrates that the Contractor has increased manpower beyond the planned levels.\n\nThe increase in manpower is directly attributable to the 'Acceleration' measures implemented by the Contractor to mitigate delays caused by the Employer.\n\nFor the missing Daily Progress reports (DPR\u2019s), the Contractor considered the values based on weekly averages.\n\nFor the period from 04 November 2023 to 18 December 2023, the Contractor's cumulative total actual Direct Manpower is 159,334 Man-days, compared to a cumulative planned Manpower of 117,180 Man-days\n\nThe total additional Direct Manpower incurred by the Contractor is 42,154 Man-days (i.e., 505,853 Man-hrs).\n\nThe average cost considered by the Contractor is OMR 6.5 per Manhour. Accordingly, the total additional cost incurred by the Contractor for mobilizing additional Manpower is OMR 3,288,045.\n\nThe Contractor is entitled for reimbursement of these additional costs incurred by the Contractor. The detailed calculation of the claim has been attached as Annexure 02 of this report.\n\nEQUIPMENT:\n\nThe Contractor in the Daily Progress reports (DPR\u2019s) submitted to Employer, provided the details of Planned and Actual \u2018HV Equipment and other Equipment\u2019 present at Site.

The detailed calculation of the claim is attached as Annexure 03 of this report.\n\n\n\nPART - 6\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\n\nThe Contractor, as assessed in the delay report, has meticulously documented the delays and disruptions encountered during the execution of the Call-Off Contract for Main Mechanical Works at the Sohar Refinery (SR1) and Polypropylene Plant (PP).\n\nThe Contractor has demonstrated, through comprehensive analysis and substantiation, that these delays were primarily attributable to the Employer, and were beyond the Contractor's control.\n\nPursuant to Clause 44 of the Conditions of Contract, the Contractor is entitled to an Extension of Time (EOT) up to 19 December 2023, extending from the originally planned completion date of 11 December 2023. This entitlement is based on the critical delays that impacted the project timeline, which were effectively mitigated through the Contractor's strategic implementation of acceleration measures. These measures included the mobilization of additional manpower and equipment, which were necessary to reduce the delay impact and achieve the actual completion date of 19 December 2023, as opposed to the",
            " projected completion date of 12 January 2024.\n\nFurthermore, the Contractor is entitled to compensation for the additional costs incurred as a result of these acceleration measures. The Contractor has substantiated claims for prolongation costs for the 8-day extension period, as well as additional costs associated with the increased resources deployed to mitigate the delays. The total claim amounts to OMR 6,848,928, which includes both prolongation and acceleration costs.\n\nSr No Description Amount 1 Prolongation 1,299,941 2 Acceleration- Manpower 3,288,045 3 Acceleration- Equipment 2,260,943 Total Amount 6,848,928\n\nTable 5: Summary of claims\n\nDespite the Employer's rejection of the Contractor's claims based on notification timing and resource management, the Contractor has provided evidence showing the\n\n\n\nEmployer\u2019s failure to adhere to contractual timelines. This failure had a significant impact on project execution, leading to idle resources for the Contractor due to delayed handover. Additionally, it required the Contractor to mobilize extra manpower and equipment to address the disruptions and delays.\n\nThe Contractor has consistently communicated the issues and hindrances through Daily Progress Reports, fulfilling the obligation to notify the Employer of delays as stipulated in Clause 15.1 of the General Conditions of the Contract.\n\nIn light of the documented evidence and contractual provisions, the Contractor respectfully requests the Employer to assess the claim for additional costs amounting to OMR 6,848,928.\n\nThe Contractor reserves all rights under the Contract and applicable law to seek relief for the financial burdens incurred due to these delays.\n\nThe Contractor also reserves the right to assert any additional claims or rights not expressly stated herein.

            "arded.\n\nModification and Waiver of Holders\u2019 Contractual Rights\n\nUnder certain circumstances, we can make changes to the Indenture and the securities (including the Notes). Some types of changes require the\n\napproval of each security holder affected, some require approval by a majority vote, and some changes do not require any approval at all.\n\nChanges Requiring Approval of Holders. First, there are changes that cannot be made to the securities without specific approval of holders. The\n\nfollowing is a list of those types of changes:\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nto reduce the percentage of holders of securities who must consent to a waiver or amendment of the Indenture; to reduce the rate of interest on any security or change the time for payment of interest; to reduce the principal due on any security or change the fixed maturity of any security; to waive a default in the payment of principal or interest on any security;\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\nto change the currency of payment on a security; in the case of convertible or exchangeable securities, to make changes to conversion or exchange rights that would be adverse to the interests of holders; to change the right of holders to waive an existing default by majority vote;\n\nto reduce the amount of principal or interest payable to holders following a default or change any conversion or exchange rights, or impair the right of holders to sue for payment; and to make any change to this list of changes that requires specific approval of holders.\n\nChanges Requiring a Majority Vote. The second type of change to the Indenture and the securities is the kind that requires a vote in favor by security holders owning a majority of the principal amount of the particular series affected. Most changes fall into this category, except for clarifying changes and certain other changes that would not adversely affect holders of the securities. The same vote would be required for us to obtain a waiver of an existing default. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default unless we obtain each holder\u2019s individual consent to the waiver.\n\nChanges Not Requiring Approval of Holders. The third type of change does not require any vote by holders of securities. This type includes,\n\namong others, clarifications of ambiguous contract terms and other changes that would not materially adversely affect holders of the securities.\n\nFurther Details Concerning Voting. When taking a vote, we will use the following rules to decide how much principal amount to attribute to a\n\nsecurity:\n\n\n\nFor securities denominated in one or more foreign currencies or currency units, we will use the U.S. dollar equivalent determined on the date of original issuance of these securities.\n\nSecurities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore not eligible to vote, if we have deposited or set aside in trust for the applicable holders\n\nmoney for their payment or redemption. A security does not cease to be outstanding because we or an affiliate of us is holding the security.\n\nWe will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of outstanding securities that are entitled to\n\nvote or take other action under the Indenture. However, the Indenture does not oblige us to fix any record date at all. If we set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of a particular series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding securities of that series on the record date and must be taken within 90 days following the record date.\n\nHolders who hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d and other indirect holders, including holders of any securities issued as global securities, should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the Indenture or the securities or request a waiver.\n\nDischarge of Our Obligations\n\nWe can fully discharge ourselves from any payment or other obligations on the securities of any series if we make a deposit for the applicable\n\nholders with the trustee and certain other conditions are met. The deposit must be held in trust for the benefit of all direct holders of the securities and must be a combination of money and U.S. government or U.S. government agency notes or bonds that will generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the securities on their various due dates.\n\nHowever, we cannot discharge ourselves from the obligations under any convertible or exchangeable securities, unless we provide for it in the\n\nterms of these securities.\n\nIf we accomplish full discharge, as described above, holders will have to rely solely on the trust deposit for repayment of the securities. Holders\n\ncould not look to us for repayment in the unlikely event of any shortfall.\n\nConversely, the trust deposit would most likely be protected from claims of our lenders and other creditors if we ever become bankrupt or insolvent.\n\nWe will indemnify the trustee and holders against any tax, fee or other",
            " holders of a majority in principal amount of the relevant series of debt securities may waive a default for all the relevant series of debt\n\nsecurities. If this happens, the default will be treated as if it had not occurred. No one can waive a payment default on a holder\u2019s debt security, however, without such holder\u2019s individual approval.\n\nWe Will Give the Trustee Information About Defaults Annually\n\nEvery year we will give to the trustee a written statement of one of our officers certifying that to the best of his or her knowledge we are in\n\ncompliance with the Indenture and all the securities under it, or else specifying any default.\n\nThe trustee may withhold from holders notice of any uncured default, except for payment defaults, if it determines that withholding notice is in\n\nholders\u2019 interest.\n\nHolders who hold in \u201cstreet name\u201d and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the trustee and how to make or cancel a declaration of acceleration.\n\nRegarding the Trustee\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee under the Indenture. In addition, affiliates of The Bank of New York Mellon may perform various\n\ncommercial banking and investment banking services for us and our subsidiaries from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE 4.250% GLOBAL NOTES DUE 2043\n\nThe following summary of AT&T\u2019s above referenced debt securities is based on and qualified by the indenture, dated as of May 15, 2013, with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., acting as trustee (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the 4.250% Global Notes due 2043 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). For a complete description of the terms and provisions of the Notes, please refer to the Indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to AT&T\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and to the form of Notes, which is filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, 2013.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Notes:\n\nwere issued in an aggregate initial principal amount of \u00a31,000,000,000, which remains the amount outstanding, subject to our ability to issue additional Notes which may be of the same series as the Notes as described under \u201c- Further Issues\u201d;\n\nmature on June 1, 2043; \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nbear interest at the rate of 4.250% per annum, payable annually in arrears; are repayable at par at maturity; are redeemable by us at the time described below under \u201c- Optional Redemption\u201d and in connection with certain tax events as described below under \u201c- Redemption Upon a Tax Event\u201d; and are not subject to any sinking fund.\n\n\n\nThe Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank pari passu with all other indebtedness issued under our Indenture. The Notes constitute a single series under the Indenture. The Notes are issued in fully registered form only and in minimum denominations of \u00a3100,000 and integral multiples of \u00a31,000 in excess thereof. Principal and interest payments on the Notes are payable by us in pound sterling. Payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, in respect of the Notes will be made to Euroclear System, Clearstream Banking S.A. or such nominee or common depositary, as the case may be, as registered holder thereof. Under the terms of the Indenture, if the pound sterling ceases to exist when payments on the Notes are due under any circumstances, AT&T may supplement the Indenture to allow for payment in U.S. dollars. The principal and interest payable in U.S. dollars on a Note at maturity, or upon redemption, will be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds against presentation of a Note at the office of the paying agent.\n\nFor purposes of the Notes, a business day means a business day in the City of New York and London.\n\nInterest\n\nThe Notes bear interest at the rate of 4.250% per annum.\n\nWe pay interest on the Notes annually in arrears on June 1, commencing on June 1, 2014, to the persons in whose names the Notes are registered\n\nat the close of business on the May 15 preceding the interest payment date.\n\nThe Notes will mature on June 1, 2043.\n\nInterest on the Notes is computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual\n\nnumber of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes, to but excluding the next scheduled interest payment date.

Dollars in millions except per share amounts\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $666 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based payment arrangements outstanding. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.21 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the year was $452 for 2024, compared to $592 for 2023 and $783 for 2022.\n\nNOTE 16. STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 AND MEZZANINE EQUITY\n\nAuthorized Shares We have authorized 14 billion common shares of AT&T stock and 10 million preferred shares of AT&T stock, each with a par value of $1.00 per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following: \u2022 Series A: 48 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference and a dividend\n\nrate of 5.000%.\n\nSeries B: 20 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with a \u20ac100,000 per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of 2.875%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025. On January 31, 2025, we issued a call notice for the Series B cumulative preferred shares, with a redemption date of March 3, 2025.\n\nSeries C: 70 thousand shares outstanding at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with a $25,000 per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of 4.75%.\n\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&T at the liquidation price on or after five years from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events.\n\nStock Repurchase Program From time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock. Over the past few years, these repurchases have generally been for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. In December 2024, the Board approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10,000 of common stock and terminated the March 2014 authorization.\n\nTo implement repurchase authorizations, we have used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2024, we repurchased approximately 36 thousand shares totaling $1 and during 2023, there were no shares repurchased under the March 2014 authorization.\n\nDividend Declarations In December 2024 and December 2023, AT&T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $36. In December 2024 and December 2023, AT&T declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.2775 per share of common stock.\n\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries We have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration.\n\nMobility II Preferred Interests In 2018, we issued 320 million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), which paid cash distributions of 7% per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions were declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred interests did not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. All outstanding Mobility preferred interests were repurchased as of April 2023, leaving no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n\nPrior to repurchase, a holder of the Mobility preferred interests could put the interests to Mobility II, or Mobility II could have redeemed the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022, with either option only allowed to be exercised during certain periods.\n\nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option could be exercised was the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) twenty-five dollars plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price was to be paid with cash, AT&T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&T common stock, at Mobility II\u2019s sole election. In no event was Mobility II required to deliver more than 250 million shares",
            " of AT&T common stock to settle put and redemption options.\n\nOn October 24, 2022, approximately 105 million Mobility preferred interests were put to AT&T by a third-party investor, for which we paid approximately $2,600 cash to redeem. On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining 213 million, or approximately $5,340, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately 107 million shares, or $2,670. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $2,670 recorded in current liabilities as \u201cAccounts payable and\n\n83\n\nAT&T Inc. Dollars in millions except per share amounts\n\naccrued liabilities,\u201d representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $2,670 recorded in \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities.\u201d The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 213 million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $5,340 and paid cash distributions of $373 per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414.\n\nTower Holdings Preferred Interests In 2019, we issued $6,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $6,000 if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\n\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the \u201c2019 Tower preferred interests\u201d). The 2019 Tower preferred interests were subject to reset in December 2024 and included a September series (Tower Class A-1) totaling $1,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 5.0%, and a December series (Tower Class A-2) totaling $4,500 that paid an initial preferred distribution of 4.75%.\n\nIn August 2024, we amended the 2019 Tower preferred interests, effective November 2024, to reset the rate and restructure the membership interests whereby all of the 2019 Tower preferred interests are now designated Fixed Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Fixed Rate Interests). A portion of the Tower Fixed Rate Interests will move to Floating Rate Class A Limited Membership Interests (Tower Floating Rate Interests) each year over a five-year period. The Tower Fixed Rate Interests pay a preferred distribution of 5.90%, and the Tower Floating Rate Interests, which could equal $525 by 2028 if not called prior, pay a preferred distribution equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 250 basis points, as defined in the agreement. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every five years. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower Fixed Rate Interests or Tower Floating Rate Interests (collectively, the \u201cTower preferred interests\u201d) would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning in November 2029, and we can call the Tower Floating Rate Interests at any time. The Tower preferred interests are included in \u201cNoncontrolling interest\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&T to pay the preferred distribution for two or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\n\nTelco LLC Preferred Interests In September 2020, we issued $2,000 nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunications-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an"
