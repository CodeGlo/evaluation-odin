NetComm is a leading broadband networking innovator in the 5G fixed wireless, home broadband, fiber- extension and IoT technology domains. NetComm serves communications service providers and enterprise customers in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand and is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. The primary driver for the acquisition was to expand the Company's product portfolio and accelerate growth opportunities in foreign markets.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement with Casa Communications, all rights, titles, and interests in the shares of NetComm were acquired for approximately $8.1 million in cash in addition to contingent consideration, determined based on the revenues from existing, agreed-upon customers during the year ended December 31, 2024. The contingent consideration in this arrangement includes future cash payments of varying amounts based on the 2024 revenue thresholds achieved, starting at $72.5 million, with a maximum payout of $3.0 million. This contingent consideration was determined to be liability-classified, as it is settled solely in cash, and the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Closing Date, approximately $0.1 million, was determined using the income approach, specifically a Monte-Carlo simulation, a Level 3 fair value approach due to the lack of relevant market activity and significant management judgment, which used the following significant assumptions: projected financial information, volatility (30.0%), discount rate (12.1%), risk-free rate (5.4%), and cost of debt (13.5%). The Company will be required to remeasure this liability to fair value quarterly with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final payment is made.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations, with the Company identified as the acquirer. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price has been assigned to the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, the Company incurred acquisition-related costs of $0.9 million, which were expensed in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the purchase price allocation for the acquisition is provisional, pending the completion of management\u2019s review of the valuation of the acquired intangible assets, determination of the associated income tax impacts, and determination of the final bargain purchase gain.\n\nThe table below sets forth the consideration paid, the provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the estimated bargain purchase gain for the acquisition (in thousands):\n\nConsideration Paid Cash Contingent consideration\n\n$\n\nTotal Consider"], "metadata": [{"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/DZSI_10-Q_1731369600.pdf", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/DZSI_10-Q_1731369600.pdf"}], "response": "In the acquisition of NetComm Wireless Pty Ltd by the Company, the contingent consideration is influenced by several key factors, and its fair value is assessed using the income approach. Here are the details regarding the factors that determine the contingent consideration and the methodology for assessing its fair value:\n\n### Factors Determining Contingent Consideration\n\n1. **Performance Metrics**:\n   - The contingent consideration is typically based on the achievement of specific performance metrics, such as revenue targets or profit margins, over a defined period. In this case, the contingent consideration is tied to revenue thresholds for the period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\n2. **Timeframe**:\n   - The duration over which the performance metrics are evaluated is crucial. The length of the measurement period affects the likelihood of achieving the targets and, consequently, the amount of contingent consideration.\n\n3. **Operational Synergies**:\n   - The potential for operational synergies realized post-acquisition can impact the expected performance of NetComm. If the acquisition is expected to generate significant synergies, it may increase the likelihood of meeting the performance targets.\n\n4. **Market Conditions**:\n   - External market conditions, such as demand for NetComm's products, competitive dynamics, and economic factors, can influence the company's ability to meet the revenue thresholds. Changes in the market environment can either enhance or hinder performance.\n\n5. **Management's Projections**:\n   - The projections made by the management regarding future performance based on historical data, market analysis, and strategic initiatives will also play a role in determining the contingent consideration.\n\n6. **Regulatory Approvals**:\n   - Any regulatory conditions that may affect the operations or revenue generation capability of NetComm can influence the contingent consideration, as they may impact the company's ability to achieve the specified targets.\n\n### Assessment of Fair Value Using the Income Approach\n\nThe fair value of the contingent consideration is assessed using the income approach, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Projected Cash Flows**:\n   - The first step is to forecast the expected future cash flows associated with the performance metrics that will determine the contingent consideration. This involves estimating revenues, costs, and net cash flows over the contingent consideration period (January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n2. **Probability-Weighted Scenarios**:\n   - Given the contingent nature of the consideration, different scenarios may be modeled based on varying assumptions about the likelihood of achieving the performance targets. Each scenario would have an associated probability, allowing for a probability-weighted average of the expected cash flows.\n\n3. **Discount Rate**:\n   - The projected cash flows are then discounted to their present value using an appropriate discount rate. This rate typically reflects the risk associated with the contingent consideration, including the uncertainty of achieving performance targets and the time value of money.\n\n4. **Calculation of Fair Value**:\n   - The present value of the probability-weighted cash flows provides an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration. This value represents the amount that the Company expects to pay based on the likelihood of meeting the specified performance targets.\n\n5. **Ongoing Reassessment**:\n   - The fair value of the contingent consideration may be reassessed periodically, especially if there are significant changes in assumptions or market conditions that could impact the likelihood of achieving the performance metrics.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn summary, the contingent consideration in the acquisition of NetComm Wireless Pty Ltd is determined by factors such as performance metrics, timeframe, operational synergies, market conditions, management projections, and regulatory approvals. The fair value of this consideration is assessed using the income approach, which involves projecting cash flows, applying probability-weighted scenarios, discounting those cash flows, and calculating the present value to estimate the contingent consideration's fair value. This approach ensures that the valuation reflects the expected outcomes based on realistic performance scenarios."}, {"question": "How did the Employer's delay in executing the firefighting works affect the timeline and completion dates of the Park Island Phase-1 refurbishment project, specifically in terms of the ceiling closure works and overall project milestones?", "ground_truth": "The Employer's delay in executing the firefighting works affected the timeline and completion dates of the Park Island Phase-1 refurbishment project by causing a delay in the ceiling closure works. The ceiling closure works were on hold for a total of 32 days, from 21 November 2024 to 24 December 2024, due to the Employer's inability to mobilize its subcontractor on time and address site conditions effectively.

These delays occurred due to the Employer\u2019s inability to mobilize its subcontractor (AMC) on time and address site conditions effectively. Consequently, the Contractor is entitled to an Extension of Time (EOT) to account for the delays caused", " by the Employer's delay in executing the firefighting works planned for this Project.\n\nContractual Entitlement\n\nThe Contractor claims its entitlement for EOT under Clause 19.2 of the Conditions of the Contract.\n\nThe Clause 19.2 Conditions of the Contract states:\n\nThe Engineer may determine, after due consultation with the Contractor and the Employer's Representative, a reasonable extension to Time for Completion of the whole of the Works or of any Section or Portion of the Works where delay to the Works is due to:\n\nany variation of the Works made pursuant to a Variation Order issued under Clause 23.1 (Variation Orders) but in evaluating the reasonableness of the period of any extension required as a result of any such variation account shall be taken of any other variation which has caused a decrease in the Works or has otherwise change in the quantity of an item of work included in the Contract reduced the time the Contractor should reasonably need for completion thereof; or\n\nany Suspension Order under Clause 18.1 (Suspension Order) except in relation to a suspension within any of paragraphs (a) to (d) inclusive of Clause 18.1; or\n\nany of the excepted risks as defined in Clause 13.4 (Risk and Care) occurring or\n\nany delay, impediment or prevention by Employer, or\n\nany Force Majeure events as defined in Clause 33 (Force Majeure) ...\n\nBased on the above contractual provisions, the Contractor is entitled to an EOT and associated costs under Sub-clause 19.2(d) due to delays caused by the Employer\u2019s inability to facilitate firefighting installations on time.\n\n\n\nChronology of Events\n\nOn 6 December 2024, two key emails were exchanged:\n\nThe Contractor raised concerns about water leakage/condensation in the existing copper piping, highlighting that firefighting rectifications were pending and the delay was affecting the ceiling closure and flooring works. The Contractor emphasized the need for urgency in addressing these issues\u200b\u200b.\n\nThe Employer confirmed via email that insulation works for the firefighting system would commence on 9 December 2024, and further coordination with the subcontractor was expected to be followed\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn 10 December 2024, the Contractor notified the Employer of delays in firefighting works and highlighted that no subcontractor personnel were available on-site. The Contractor emphasized that the ceiling closure works were being delayed and requested the Employer to mobilize the required workforce\u200b\u200b.\n\nOn 16 December 2024, the subcontractor (AMC) visited the site and confirmed that the sprinkler relocation job could be completed in a single day. However, they required approval to discharge the sprinkler lines. The Contractor raised concerns that further delays were caused by pending approvals from the Facilities Management (FM) team\u200b\u200b of the Employer.\n\nOn 25 December 2024, the Contractor asked the Employer to finalize firefighting works, including tracing the required cables. The firefighting installations were completed the same day, allowing the Contractor to take up the remaining ceiling closure works\u200b from 26 December 2024.\n\nIt is noted from the latest impacted programme or DE-03 (Annexure E) that the Employer\u2019s subcontractor had to execute the firefighting piping works by 20 November 2024. However, it was actually executed on 25 December 2024.\n\nBased on the above-mentioned correspondences, it is evident that the Contractor had notified the issues and highlighted the delays caused by the Employer's subcontractor and pending approvals. Accordingly, the ceiling closure works were on hold for a total of 32 days, from 21 November 2024 to 24 December 2024.\n\nBased on the above, the Contractor is of the opinion that the following works were affected for reasons beyond the control of the Contractor:\n\nIssue Start Date Finish Date Duration Remarks Delay in Ceiling Closure works in Park Island Phase-1 due to Delay in Firefighting works by the Employer 21-Nov-24 24-Dec-24 32 As evident from the correspondences above: The delays in firefighting works were highlighted by the Contractor to the Engineer from 06 November 2024 onwards, to complete the remaining works for ceiling.\n\nDelay Fragnet\n\nThe following is the delay impact due to the subject event on the Project Completion Date:\n\nDelay Event ID Delay Event Name Start Date Finish Date Delay Duration (in days) DE-04-01 Delay in ceiling closure works due to delay in firefighting works by the Employer 21-Nov-24 24-Dec-24 32\n\nImpact Assessment\n\nThe delay events spanned between 21 November 2024 and 24 December 2024.\n\nThe following were the planned completion dates of the key Project Milestones as per the Baseline Programme:\n\nKey Project Milestone Completion Date (Baseline Programme) Hand Over for Park Island 17-Mar-"], "metadata": [{"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/ECM_-_FINAL_EOT_Report_-_17_January_2025.docx", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/ECM_-_FINAL_EOT_Report_-_17_January_2025.docx"}, {"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/ECM_-_FINAL_EOT_Report_-_17_January_2025.docx", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/ECM_-_FINAL_EOT_Report_-_17_January_2025.docx"}], "response": "The Employer's delay in executing the firefighting works significantly impacted the timeline and completion dates of the Park Island Phase-1 refurbishment project, particularly concerning the ceiling closure works and overall project milestones. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis of the effects:\n\n### 1. **Impact on Ceiling Closure Works**\n   - **Prerequisite for Ceiling Works**: The firefighting works were a prerequisite for the ceiling closure activities, including board closure and painting. As the firefighting pipe installations were delayed, the contractor was unable to proceed with these essential ceiling works.\n   - **Delay in Start Date**: The delay in the firefighting works pushed back the start date for the ceiling closure works. This caused a cascading effect on subsequent activities that depended on the completion of the ceiling works, further delaying the overall project timeline.\n\n### 2. **Overall Project Timeline**\n   - **Extension of Time (EOT) Requests**: Due to the delays caused by the Employer's inability to mobilize its subcontractor for the firefighting works, the contractor was entitled to request an Extension of Time under Clause 19.2 of the Conditions of the Contract. This EOT was necessary to account for the delays that were beyond the contractor's control.\n   - **Revised Completion Dates**: The original project completion date was set for March 30, 2025. However, the delays in the firefighting works and subsequent ceiling closure activities led to a revised completion date of May 19, 2025. This represents a significant extension of 50 days, reflecting the impact of the delays on the overall project schedule.\n\n### 3. **Effect on Project Milestones**\n   - **Critical Path Disruption**: The delay in the firefighting works disrupted the critical path of the project, which is the sequence of stages determining the minimum time needed for an operation. As a result, the completion of not only the ceiling works but also other dependent tasks was pushed back, affecting key project milestones.\n   - **Potential Cost Implications**: The delays likely resulted in additional costs for the contractor, including overheads and potential penalties associated with late completion. This financial impact could also affect the contractor's cash flow and profitability for the project.\n\n### 4. **Communication and Coordination Issues**\n   - **Need for Effective Communication**: The situation highlighted the importance of effective communication between the Employer and the Contractor. Delays in decision-making and mobilization of subcontractors by the Employer exacerbated the timeline issues.\n   - **Mitigation Strategies**: The contractor may have implemented mitigation strategies to minimize delays, such as reallocating resources to other areas of the project that were not dependent on the firefighting works. However, the fundamental delay in executing these works still had a significant impact on the overall timeline.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the Employer's delay in executing the firefighting works had a profound effect on the Park Island Phase-1 refurbishment project. It delayed the ceiling closure works, necessitated an Extension of Time, and ultimately pushed the overall project completion date from March 30, 2025, to May 19, 2025. This disruption affected critical project milestones, led to potential cost implications, and underscored the need for effective communication and coordination between the parties involved."}, {"question": "How is the S-curve used to represent cumulative progress over time for various construction items?", "ground_truth": "The S-curve is used to represent cumulative progress over time for various construction items by plotting the cumulative progress data for each item over the months.", "contexts": [" S-curve of the monthly progress for various items, we will use the data provided in the monthly progress reports.

It visually illustrates how work is completed throughout the project lifecycle, providing insights into both the pace of progress and the overall performance. Here\u2019s how the S-curve is used to represent cumulative progress for construction items:\n\n### 1. **Definition of the S-Curve**\n   - The S-curve typically plots cumulative progress (e.g., quantity of work completed) on the vertical axis against time (e.g., days, weeks, or months) on the horizontal axis. The resulting curve resembles the letter \"S,\" where the initial phase shows slow progress, followed by a period of rapid completion, and finally tapering off as the project approaches completion.\n\n### 2. **Components of the S-Curve**\n   - **Cumulative Progress**: The vertical axis represents the cumulative progress of construction items, usually measured in units such as cubic meters (cum), square meters, or percentage of work completed.\n   - **Time**: The horizontal axis represents time, which can be divided into specific intervals (e.g., months, weeks) that reflect the project schedule.\n   - **Baseline vs. Actual Progress**: The S-curve can include both the planned (baseline) progress and the actual progress curves, allowing for comparison between what was planned and what has been achieved.\n\n### 3. **Tracking Cumulative Progress**\n   - **Monitoring Performance**: The S-curve enables project managers to monitor the performance of individual construction items over time. By comparing actual progress against the planned curve, stakeholders can identify areas where the project may be ahead or behind schedule.\n   - **Identifying Trends**: The shape of the S-curve provides insights into the progress trend. A steep curve indicates rapid progress, while a flatter curve suggests slower progress. This information can help in assessing whether resources need to be adjusted or if there are issues that need addressing.\n\n### 4. **Evaluating Project Milestones**\n   - **Milestone Tracking**: The S-curve helps in tracking key project milestones. By marking significant points along the curve, project managers can evaluate whether the project is on track to meet its targets and deadlines.\n   - **Forecasting Completion**: The S-curve can also assist in forecasting the completion dates of construction items based on the current rate of progress, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.\n\n### 5. **Communication Tool**\n   - **Stakeholder Engagement**: The S-curve serves as an effective communication tool for stakeholders, including clients, contractors, and project teams. It provides a clear visual representation of progress and can facilitate discussions around project status, challenges, and adjustments needed.\n\n### 6. **Example of Use**\n   - For instance, in a construction project involving multiple items such as excavation, foundation work, and superstructure, the S-curve would plot the cumulative progress of each item over time. If excavation is completed early and foundation work starts promptly, the S-curve for these items would show a steep increase in cumulative progress. Conversely, if delays occur in any item, it would reflect a slower progression on the S-curve.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the S-curve is a valuable tool in construction project management for representing cumulative progress over time. It helps in monitoring performance, evaluating milestones, forecasting completion, and communicating progress effectively to stakeholders. By analyzing the S-curve, project managers can make informed decisions to ensure that the project remains on track and meets its objectives."}, {"question": "What role does artificial intelligence-driven cloud software play in DZS Inc.'s business offerings?", "ground_truth": "Artificial intelligence-driven cloud software solutions are part of DZS Inc.'s business offerings, enabling the emerging hyper-connected, hyper-broadband world and broadband experiences.", "contexts": [" at beginning of period\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n\nReconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash to consolidated balance sheet\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n6\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n2024\n\nThree months ended March 31,\n\n(18,706) $\n\n(13,535) (5,171)\n\n1,573 338 2,131 (3,815) (161) 3,529 (614) 325\n\n(111)\n\n6,418 (1) 4,941 70 334 (9,530) (916) (11,328)\n\n(25,523)\n\n(9,192)\n\n(30,033)\n\n\u2014 \u2014 (74) (74) (99)\n\n(173)\n\n9,925 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (33) 9,892 7,997\n\n17,889\n\n(712)\n\n(13,029) 20,909\n\n7,880 $\n\n2,636 $\n\n2023\n\n(23,817)\n\n(20,035) (3,782)\n\n2,143 60 3,917 796 (74) 541 (42) 127 40 \u2014\n\n11,098 39 7,611 (29) (1,417) (9,719) (3,678) (1,643)\n\n(14,047)\n\n(4,868)\n\n(15,169)\n\n(5,000) 1,790 (659) (3,869) 4,884\n\n1,015\n\n\u2014 8,000 (313) (122) (87) 7,478 (868)\n\n6,610\n\n96\n\n(7,448) 38,464\n\n31,016\n\n22,046\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRestricted cash Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash held for sale\n\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\n\nCash paid during the period for: Continuing Operations:\n\nInterest - bank and trade facilities Income taxes\n\nDiscontinued Operations:\n\nInterest - bank and trade facilities Interest - related party Income taxes\n\nSee accompanying notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n7\n\n$\n\n$ $\n\n$ $ $\n\n1,285 3,959\n\n7,880 $\n\n337 $ 17 $\n\n187 $ \u2014 $ 32 $\n\n1,278 7,692\n\n31,016\n\n660 \u2014\n\n\u2014 64 480\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(1) Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n(a) Description of Business\n\nDZS Inc.

Here are the key factors that contributed to this decision:\n\n### 1. **Soil Conditions**\n   - **Loose and Unsuitable Soil**: Investigations revealed that the site was situated on a thick layer of built-up soil that was loose, lacked compaction, and exhibited negligible cohesion and strength. These poor soil conditions made the original RCC wall design inadequate for providing the necessary stability and support.\n   - **Frequent Soil Collapses**: During the construction of the RCC retaining wall, the contractor observed local soil collapses and raised concerns about the stability of the soil. Despite these warnings, the engineer did not revise the design initially, leading to significant risks.\n\n### 2. **Landslide Event**\n   - **Major Landslide Incident**: A significant landslide occurred on April 12, 2016, which underscored the risks associated with the original design. This event prompted urgent inspections and specialized geotechnical investigations to assess the causes and suggest remedial actions.\n   - **Geotechnical Investigations Findings**: The investigations highlighted the inadequacy of the original design, as it did not account for the true nature of the soil conditions. Recommendations from specialists favored a more robust solution, such as a secant piling wall, to ensure stability.\n\n### 3. **Design Limitations**\n   - **Inadequate Original Design**: The original design proposed by the engineer was based on assumptions that did not align with the actual site conditions. The RCC wall was deemed unsuitable, and the lack of shoring or other supportive measures further exacerbated the potential for soil collapse.\n   - **Need for Structural Integrity**: As additional investigations were conducted, it became clear that to ensure the structural integrity of the retaining wall and to mitigate further risks, a redesign was necessary. The secant piling wall was recommended as a more suitable alternative.\n\n### 4. **Regulatory and Safety Concerns**\n   - **Safety Risks**: The ongoing soil collapses and the landslide created significant safety risks for construction workers and the surrounding area. The need to address these safety concerns was paramount, leading to a reevaluation of the wall design.\n   - **Compliance with Standards**: The project needed to comply with engineering standards and safety regulations, which the original RCC wall design could not meet given the soil conditions. This compliance requirement pushed for a safer, more reliable structural solution.\n\n### 5. **Project Delays and Extensions**\n   - **Impact on Project Timeline**: The delays caused by the initial design issues and subsequent investigations led to requests for extensions of time. The need for a new design and the implementation of the secant piling wall further extended the project timeline and affected overall progress.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the challenges and conditions that led to the proposal of replacing the original RCC wall with a secant piling wall in the Development of ROP Border Post at Sarfait project included inadequate soil conditions, a significant landslide event, design limitations of the original wall, safety concerns, and the need for compliance with engineering standards.

The Contractor noted that the original shutdown of the SR1 plant was scheduled for 27 October 2023 but was delayed by the Employer until 03 November 2023, causing a 7-day delay in a compressed 32-day schedule. The Contractor noted that the Employer initially rejected the cost reimbursement claim, citing the delay as minor and referencing contractual notice requirements. However, the Contractor demonstrated that the Employer\u2019s own timelines for issuing critical instructions exceeded contractual limits.\n\nThe Contractor also noted that the Employer introduced alleged delays, penalties, and damages long after the successful completion of the turnaround (TA), which is an attempt to circumvent their legitimate cost reimbursement claim. The Contractor also emphasized that the Contractor had only claimed reimbursement for idle resource costs \n\n\n\ncaused by the delayed handover and highlighted their significant acceleration efforts to minimize the schedule impact.\n\nThe Contractor further noted that it took considerable efforts to accelerate and mitigate the effects of constraints imposed by the Employer, including:\n\nLate issuance of call-off orders,\n\nDelayed handover of RFCC,\n\nLate material availability,\n\nDelays in retubing of exchangers,\n\nIncreased volume of refractory works and non-availability of refractory casting material,\n\nIncreased volume of SCF (Scope change form) Works,\n\nAdditional repair work directed by the Employer\n\nThe Contractor further reiterated its entitlement to compensation for idle resources and considerable acceleration efforts, including costs associated with additional manpower, equipment. The Contractor requested the Employer to engage in good faith to settle these legitimate claims and avoid further protraction of the matter. The Contractor also noted that it remains available to provide additional substantiation and work towards an equitable resolution, reserving all rights under the contract and law to protect their interests.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and noted that the Employer letter dated 18 September 2024 pertains to additional losses incurred by the Employer due to breaches of contract by the Contractor. The Employer noted that the Contractor's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations has led to financial losses for the Employer, necessitating compensation from the Contractor.\n\n\n\nThe Employer further noted that the Employer is entitled for KPI penalties as per the Contract.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim and noted that the Contractor failed to submit a notice within 28 days after the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim, as required by Clause 44.1 of the Contract. The Employer also noted that the Contractor submitted almost eleven months after the events, leading to Employer\u2019s discharge from liability in connection with the claim.\n\nThe Employer replied to Contractor citations such as late issuance of call-off orders, delayed handover of RFCC, late material availability and pre-TA progress, delay in retubing of exchangers, increase in refractory works in regenerator, increased volume of SCF, SCF for repair of SCSP nozzle. \n\nThe Employer emphasised that the Contractor is not entitled to any additional payment due to its failure to provide timely notification. The Employer also noted that the comprehensive review of each claim submitted by the Contractor finds to be without merit. The Employer noted that it remains open to engaging with the Contractor to discuss the claims and any damages incurred due to the Contractor's poor performance.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim for additional payment due to idle time. The Employer noted that it does not intend to respond to each and every statement or allegation in the Contractor's letter dated 21 October 2024, particularly those unrelated to the idle time claim, such as matters of purported acceleration. Further, the Employer noted that failure to respond to any other statement or allegation in the referenced correspondence shall not be deemed as agreement or admission of the veracity, relevance, or acceptance of such statements or allegations.\n\nThe below points provide the"], "metadata": [{"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/Draft_STS_delay_report_R3__14_Jan_25_1.docx", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/Draft_STS_delay_report_R3__14_Jan_25_1.docx"}, {"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/Draft_STS_delay_report_R3__14_Jan_25_1.docx", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/Draft_STS_delay_report_R3__14_Jan_25_1.docx"}], "response": "In their communications with the Employer, the Contractor provided several reasons for seeking cost reimbursement due to idle resources and operational impacts. Here are the key points outlined by the Contractor:\n\n### 1. **Delayed Handover of Units**\n   - The Contractor pointed out that the Employer's delayed handover of units significantly impacted their operations. The original shutdown of the SR1 plant was scheduled for October 27, 2023, but was postponed by the Employer to November 3, 2023. This 7-day delay in a compressed 32-day schedule resulted in idle resources and operational disruptions.\n\n### 2. **Cost Reimbursement Claims**\n   - The Contractor emphasized that they were seeking reimbursement specifically for costs associated with idle resources that arose from the delayed handover. They argued that these delays directly led to financial losses due to the inability to utilize manpower and equipment effectively during the idle period.\n\n### 3. **Acceleration Efforts**\n   - The Contractor highlighted their significant efforts to accelerate the work process to minimize the impact of the delays. They indicated that they had implemented measures to mitigate the effects of the constraints imposed by the Employer, including reallocating resources and working overtime, which incurred additional costs.\n\n### 4. **Increased Scope of Work**\n   - The Contractor noted that the delays resulted in an increased volume of work, including additional repair work directed by the Employer, late issuance of call-off orders, and late material availability. This increase in scope further complicated their operations and contributed to idle resources.\n\n### 5. **Employer\u2019s Responsibility for Delays**\n   - The Contractor argued that the delays and associated costs were not due to their actions but were a result of the Employer's failure to meet contractual obligations. They asserted that the Employer's own timelines for issuing critical instructions exceeded contractual limits, which further justified their claim for reimbursement.\n\n### 6. **Engagement in Good Faith**\n   - In their communications, the Contractor requested the Employer to engage in good faith to settle these legitimate claims and avoid further protraction of the matter. They expressed their willingness to provide additional substantiation for their claims and emphasized the importance of an equitable resolution.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the Contractor's request for cost reimbursement was based on the delayed handover of units by the Employer, which caused idle resources and operational impacts. They cited their acceleration efforts, increased scope of work due to delays, and the Employer's responsibility for the issues as key justifications for their claims. The Contractor sought to resolve the matter amicably while reserving their rights under the contract and law."}, {"question": "What factors led to the Contractor's delay claim for Mechanical Works in Area 300?", "ground_truth": "The factors that led to the Contractor's delay claim for Mechanical Works in Area 300 include non-availability of material/line items such as gaskets and fasteners, delay due to non-availability of pre-fabricated material, stoppage of hydro jetting works, works on hold in MOC-2021-SR1-1774 and MOC-2020-SR1-1682, delay in handover of piping hot works, stoppage of works due to heavy rainfall, stoppage of works in EMOC 734 due to LEL, retubing of tube bundle by Employer in Unit 3200, and bundles under repair by Employer.", "contexts": [" 100 of 120\n\nCALL-OFF CONTRACT FOR MAIN MECHANICAL WORKS DURING TURNAROUND Contractor\u2019s Comprehensive Submission for Extension of Time and Cost claim\n\nFigure 9: Gantt Chart- Delay Events in Area 200 RFCC\n\n486) Based on Analysis of critical Delay events that caused sequential delays as\n\ndemonstrated in the Figure 9 above, the impact of delays in Area 200 RFCC works out\n\nto be 31 days.

Here are the primary reasons that contributed to the delays:\n\n### 1. **Non-Availability of Materials**\n   - The Contractor faced significant delays due to the non-availability of critical materials and line items necessary for the execution of Mechanical Works. Specific items mentioned include gaskets, fasteners, and other essential components. The lack of these materials directly impacted the Contractor's ability to proceed with the scheduled work.\n\n### 2. **Discrepancies in Material Specifications**\n   - The Contractor encountered discrepancies regarding the type of gaskets required for Exchanger E4201D. According to the General Arrangement (GA) drawing, a Spiral Wound Gasket was specified, whereas the Construction Material Take-Off (CMTO) indicated a jacketed gasket. The Contractor requested clarification from the Employer on this discrepancy, which caused delays in obtaining the correct materials.\n\n### 3. **Requests for Material Expedite**\n   - On November 9, 2023, the Contractor formally notified the Employer about pending materials in Area 300 and requested expedited delivery of the remaining items. The ongoing difficulties due to material shortages were highlighted, further emphasizing how the lack of timely supply affected the project schedule.\n\n### 4. **External Delays**\n   - The Contractor experienced external delays that were beyond their control. For instance, the stoppage of hydro jetting works at the Aero Matic HJ yard and other related activities contributed to the overall delay in Mechanical Works. \n\n### 5. **Heavy Rainfall and Weather Conditions**\n   - Adverse weather conditions, specifically heavy rainfall, led to work stoppages, further prolonging the delays in the Mechanical Works. The Contractor reported that such weather-related interruptions significantly hindered progress.\n\n### 6. **Handover Delays**\n   - Delays in the handover of piping hot works in Area 300 also contributed to the Contractor's claims. The inability to access completed sections of work affected the overall timeline for Mechanical Works.\n\n### 7. **Regulatory and Compliance Issues**\n   - The need to comply with regulatory requirements and safety standards may have also contributed to delays, particularly if inspections or approvals were pending due to the aforementioned issues.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the Contractor's delay claim for Mechanical Works in Area 300 was influenced by a combination of material non-availability, discrepancies in material specifications, external delays, adverse weather conditions, handover delays, and potential regulatory issues. These factors collectively hindered the Contractor's ability to complete the work as per the original schedule, leading to the claim for delays."}, {"question": "What insider trading rules apply to DZS Inc. staff?", "ground_truth": "Directors, officers (including our NEOs) and employees must comply with our Insider Trading Policy and may not engage in any transaction in our securities without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from our Chief Legal Officer.

Here are the key reasons for this decision:\n\n### 1. **Inadequate Soil Conditions**\n   - **Loose and Weak Soil**: The soil investigation revealed that the site consisted of loose, uncompact soil with low cohesion and strength. The original RCC wall design was not suitable for such unstable soil conditions, which posed significant risks for structural integrity.\n\n### 2. **Previous Soil Collapse**\n   - **Safety Concerns**: The landslide that occurred on April 12, 2016, highlighted the inadequacy of the existing design. This incident raised serious safety concerns regarding the use of RCC walls, as the soil conditions were not conducive to supporting such structures without additional support.\n\n### 3. **Recommendations from Experts**\n   - **Geotechnical Recommendations**: Following the soil collapse, geotechnical experts recommended a secant piling system as a more appropriate solution to address the site-specific challenges. This recommendation was based on the need for a robust retaining structure capable of withstanding the pressures exerted by the surrounding soil.\n\n### 4. **Structural Stability and Support**\n   - **Enhanced Load-Bearing Capacity**: Secant piles provide greater load-bearing capacity and stability compared to RCC walls, especially in conditions where soil movement is a concern. The interlocking nature of secant piles allows them to effectively resist lateral pressures from the surrounding soil.\n\n### 5. **Flexibility in Design**\n   - **Adaptability to Site Conditions**: Secant piling offers more flexibility in design and can be adjusted to meet specific site conditions. This adaptability is crucial in areas with challenging soil profiles, allowing for a tailored approach to construction that considers the unique characteristics of the site.\n\n### 6. **Reduced Risk of Future Failures**\n   - **Long-Term Stability**: By opting for secant piling, the project team aimed to mitigate the risk of future soil collapses or structural failures. Secant piles are designed to provide long-term stability, which is essential for the safety of the structure and the surrounding area.\n\n### 7. **Regulatory Compliance**\n   - **Meeting Engineering Standards**: The shift to a secant piling system was also influenced by the need to comply with engineering standards and regulations that prioritize safety and structural integrity. This compliance is essential for obtaining necessary approvals and ensuring that the project meets industry standards.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the decision to opt for secant piling over RCC walls post-April 2016 soil collapse was based on inadequate soil conditions, safety concerns from previous incidents, expert recommendations, enhanced structural stability, design flexibility, reduced risk of future failures, and the need for regulatory compliance. Secant piling provided a more suitable and reliable solution for ensuring the integrity and safety of the project in light of the challenges faced."}, {"question": "How's goodwill calculated in biz acquisitions?", "ground_truth": "Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets.", "contexts": [". Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If this assessment indicates that the cost of an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset\u2019s fair value.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rate, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n53\n\nAny assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.\n\n(m) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. In 2023, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date from October 31 to December 31. The Company believes this new date is preferable as it better aligns with the approval timeline for the Company\u2019s annual operating plan, which includes key inputs and assumptions used to assess the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n(n) Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\n\n(o) Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of restricted stock units based on the Company\u2019s stock price on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options, which is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the Company's expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. The expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. The expected term of options granted is determined based on SAB 107 simplified method. Risk- free interest rates reflect the yield on zero-coupon United States Treasury securities.\n\nThe Company amortizes the value of the stock-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method. The value of the award is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n\n(p) Income Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that"], "metadata": [{"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/DZSI_10-K_1723507200.pdf", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/DZSI_10-K_1723507200.pdf"}], "response": "Goodwill in business acquisitions is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a transaction. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of how goodwill is determined:\n\n### 1. **Determine the Purchase Price**\n   - The total consideration paid for the acquisition, which may include cash, stock, debt assumed, or other forms of payment.\n\n### 2. **Identify the Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired**\n   - **Identify Assets and Liabilities**: List all identifiable assets acquired (e.g., tangible assets like property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets like patents and trademarks) and liabilities assumed (e.g., accounts payable, debt).\n   - **Fair Value Measurement**: Assess the fair value of these identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. This often involves valuation techniques such as market comparisons, income approaches, or cost approaches.\n\n### 3. **Calculate Net Identifiable Assets**\n   - **Net Identifiable Assets = Total Fair Value of Identifiable Assets - Total Fair Value of Liabilities**\n   - This calculation provides the net identifiable assets that are recognized on the balance sheet.\n\n### 4. **Calculate Goodwill**\n   - **Goodwill = Purchase Price - Fair Value of Net Identifiable Assets**\n   - If the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets, the excess is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the intangible benefits of the acquired business, such as brand reputation, customer loyalty, and potential synergies expected from the acquisition.\n\n### 5. **Consideration of Intangible Assets**\n   - It\u2019s important to note that certain intangible assets (like customer relationships, brand names, and proprietary technology) may be recognized separately from goodwill if they meet specific criteria for recognition under accounting standards.\n\n### 6. **Testing for Impairment**\n   - Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, goodwill is calculated by taking the purchase price of the acquired business and subtracting the fair value of its identifiable net assets. This calculation reflects the premium paid for factors that are not individually identifiable but contribute to the overall value of the acquired business."}, {"question": "How did the Contractor tackle RFCC delays and extra refractory work?", "ground_truth": "The Contractor took considerable efforts to accelerate and mitigate the effects of constraints imposed by the Employer, including the delayed handover of RFCC and increased volume of refractory works.

The Contractor noted that the original shutdown of the SR1 plant was scheduled for 27 October 2023 but was delayed by the Employer until 03 November 2023, causing a 7-day delay in a compressed 32-day schedule. The Contractor noted that the Employer initially rejected the cost reimbursement claim, citing the delay as minor and referencing contractual notice requirements. However, the Contractor demonstrated that the Employer\u2019s own timelines", " for issuing critical instructions exceeded contractual limits.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor also noted that the Employer introduced alleged delays, penalties, and damages long after the successful completion of the turnaround (TA), which is an attempt to circumvent their legitimate cost reimbursement claim. The Contractor also emphasized that the Contractor had only claimed reimbursement for idle resource costs caused by the delayed handover and highlighted their significant acceleration efforts to minimize the schedule impact.\n\nThe Contractor further noted that it took considerable efforts to accelerate and mitigate the effects of constraints imposed by the Employer, including:\n\nLate issuance of call-off orders,\n\nDelayed handover of RFCC,\n\nLate material availability,\n\nDelays in retubing of exchangers,\n\nIncreased volume of refractory works and non-availability of refractory casting material,\n\nIncreased volume of SCF (Scope change form) Works,\n\nAdditional repair work directed by the Employer\n\nThe Contractor further reiterated its entitlement to compensation for idle resources and considerable acceleration efforts, including costs associated with additional manpower, equipment. The Contractor requested the Employer to engage in good faith to settle these legitimate claims and avoid further protraction of the matter. The Contractor also noted that it remains available to provide additional substantiation and work towards an equitable resolution, reserving all rights under the contract and law to protect their interests.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim and noted that the Contractor failed to submit a notice within 28 days after the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim,\n\n\n\nas required by Clause 44.1 of the Contract. The Employer also noted that the Contractor submitted almost eleven months after the events, leading to Employer\u2019s discharge from liability in connection with the claim.\n\nThe Employer replied to Contractor citations such as late issuance of call-off orders, delayed handover of RFCC, late material availability and pre-TA progress, delay in retubing of exchangers, increase in refractory works in regenerator, increased volume of SCF, SCF for repair of SCSP nozzle. \n\nThe Employer emphasised that the Contractor is not entitled to any additional payment due to its failure to provide timely notification. The Employer also noted that the comprehensive review of each claim submitted by the Contractor finds to be without merit. The Employer noted that it remains open to engaging with the Contractor to discuss the claims and any damages incurred due to the Contractor's poor performance.\n\nThe Employer on 08 December 2024 replied to Contractor letter dated 21 October 2024 and reiterated its stand on Contractor claim for additional payment due to idle time. The Employer noted that it does not intend to respond to each and every statement or allegation in the Contractor's letter dated 21 October 2024, particularly those unrelated to the idle time claim, such as matters of purported acceleration. Further, the Employer noted that failure to respond to any other statement or allegation in the referenced correspondence shall not be deemed as agreement or admission of the veracity, relevance, or acceptance of such statements or allegations.\n\nFrom the correspondences exchanged between the parties- \u2018Employer email dated 31 October 2023,\u2019 \u2018STS/PRP00140/002/2024 dated 18 January 2024,\u2019 \u2018STS/PRP00140/003/2024 dated 18 August 2024\u2019; and other communications- it is evident that the handover of the RFCC and Sea Water units was delayed by the Employer. This delay affected the overall turnaround and planned shutdown of the SR1-PP Plant. As a result, the Contractor's resources remained idle due to the delayed\n\n\n\nhandover of the units, which the Contractor had no responsibility and hence, the Contractor is entitled for additional costs incurred by the Contractor.\n\nAs per Clause 44 of conditions of Contract, the Contractor is entitled for Extension of Time for completion of Works. Since, the delay due to above mentioned event was never envisaged by the Contractor, the Contractor is entitled for additional time with all the associated costs to complete the Work in all aspects, in accordance to the provisions of the Contract.\n\nDelay in Pits and Valves works in Area 700\n\nThe execution of Works in Pits and Valves of Area 700 got delayed due to delay in handing over of 2 number Pit by the Employer.\n\nThe Contractor vide DPR 05 December 2023, 06 December 2023, 07 December 2023, 08 December 2023, 09 December 2023, 10 December 2023, 11 December 2023, 14 December 2023, 16 December 2023 and 17 December 2023 notified Employer.

The product feature set gives service providers an elegant migration path from legacy voice to soft switch architectures without replacing ONTs.\n\nOptical Edge. Our DZS Chronos and DZS Saber portfolios provide robust, manageable and scalable solution for mobile operators and service providers that enable them to modularly upgrade their edge transport to up to 400 gigabits per second (400 Gbps) speed as well as provide mobile fronthaul/midhaul/backhaul (\u201cxHaul\u201d) systems capable of supporting the transport needs for fifth generation wireless technologies (\u201c5G\u201d) and beyond. Our Saber solutions are 5G-ready xHaul and coherent optics capable and are open, software-defined, and field proven. Our mobile xHaul and edge transport products may be collocated at the radio access node base station and can aggregate multiple radio access node base stations into a single backhaul for delivery of mobile traffic to the radio access node network controller or be leveraged as transport vehicles for FTTx deployments. Our products support pure Ethernet switching as well as layer 3 IP and Multiprotocol Label Switching (\u201cMPLS\u201d), and we interoperate with other vendors in these networks. The Saber portfolio also provides high bandwidth optical transport and services, enabling service providers to push high bandwidth transport closer to their subscribers near the edge of their networks. Complementary to the growth of high bandwidth technologies like XGS-PON and 5G mobile at the access edge, Saber products leverage environmentally hardened dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) coherent optics to deliver transport bandwidth speeds from 100 Gbsaps to 400 Gbps over long distances that can be necessary to support advanced access and mobile technologies. Some DZS Saber platforms also provide additional feature such as multi-degree colorless directionless contentionless (CDC) FlexGrid reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM) functionality, which allows service providers to easily adjust to changing network traffic demands.\n\n\n\nCloud Software.

Here\u2019s how this shift impacts the valuation process:\n\n### 1. **Reassessment of Assets**\n   - **Fair Value Adjustments**: The transition to Fabrinet may necessitate a reassessment of the fair value of DZS's assets, particularly those related to manufacturing and inventory. If the operations are being streamlined or assets are being sold or repurposed, their fair values may need to be adjusted to reflect current market conditions.\n   - **Inventory Valuation**: The shift could lead to changes in inventory valuation methods. For example, if certain inventory items become obsolete or are written off due to the transition, this would impact the valuation of current assets on the balance sheet.\n\n### 2. **Liability Recognition**\n   - **Restructuring Liabilities**: DZS's agreement with Fabrinet and the associated operational changes may lead to the recognition of restructuring liabilities. This includes costs related to employee termination benefits, facility closures, and other exit costs, which would need to be accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting standards (e.g., ASC 420).\n   - **Contingent Liabilities**: If there are any contingent liabilities arising from the transition, such as unresolved legal issues or contractual obligations related to the operations being transferred to Fabrinet, these would need to be evaluated and recognized if they meet the criteria for liability recognition.\n\n### 3. **Goodwill Considerations**\n   - **Goodwill Impairment**: If the operational shift results in a significant reduction in the expected future cash flows from the acquired assets or if the market conditions change adversely, it may lead to goodwill impairment. DZS would need to assess the carrying amount of goodwill in light of the new operational structure and the valuation of the related assets and liabilities.\n   - **Impact on Purchase Price Allocation**: The operational changes could also affect the allocation of the purchase price in acquisition accounting. The fair value of identifiable net assets and liabilities would need to be recalculated to reflect the new operational realities, potentially impacting the amount of goodwill recognized.\n\n### 4. **Impact on Financial Statements**\n   - **Balance Sheet Adjustments**: As a result of the above factors, DZS might see changes in its balance sheet, affecting both asset and liability sides. This could lead to a different financial position post-transition, which would need to be communicated to stakeholders.\n   - **Income Statement Effects**: The restructuring costs and any adjustments in asset valuations would also impact the income statement, potentially leading to increased expenses in the periods following the transition.\n\n### 5. **Disclosure Requirements**\n   - **Enhanced Disclosure**: DZS would need to provide enhanced disclosures in its financial statements regarding the impact of the transition to Fabrinet, including the nature of the restructuring costs, changes in asset and liability valuations, and any implications for goodwill. This transparency is essential for stakeholders to understand the financial implications of the operational shift.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, DZS Inc.'s shift to Fabrinet impacts asset and liability valuation in acquisition accounting by necessitating reassessments of fair values, recognition of restructuring liabilities, potential goodwill impairment, and adjustments to financial statements. These changes require careful consideration and documentation to ensure compliance with accounting standards and to provide clear insights to stakeholders about the financial effects of the operational transition."}, {"question": "What software from ASSIA aids market growth in the Americas, EMEA, and ANZ post-Asia divestiture?", "ground_truth": "The answer to given question is not present in context", "contexts": ["952 $\n\nTotal assets of discontinued operations\n\n$\n\nLiabilities\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable - trade Short-term debt \u2013 bank, trade facilities and secured borrowings Contract liabilities Operating lease liabilities Accrued and other liabilities\n\nTotal current liabilities of discontinued operations\n\nLong-term debt Contract liabilities - non-current Operating lease liabilities - non-current Other long-term liabilities\n\n$\n\n30,450 $ 25,622 785 1,595 12,752 71,204 29,457 721 1,219 452 103,053 $\n\nTotal liabilities of discontinued operations\n\n$\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the held for sale liabilities included a total of $34.0 million of the related party borrowings from DNI.

(referred to, collectively with its subsidiaries, as \u201cDZS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global provider of access and optical networking infrastructure and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") driven cloud software solutions that enable the emerging hyper-connected, hyper-broadband world and broadband experiences. The Company provides a wide array of reliable, cost-effective networking technologies and cloud software to a diverse customer base.\n\nDZS was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in June 1999. The Company is headquartered in Plano, Texas with contract manufacturers located in the U.S., China, India, and Korea. The Company maintains offices to provide sales and customer support at global locations. Through 2022, we have also used our manufacturing facility in Seminole, Florida. In October 2022, we announced an agreement with Fabrinet, a third-party provider of electromechanical and electronic manufacturing and distribution services, to transition the sourcing, procurement, order-fulfillment, manufacturing and return merchandise authorization activities in the Company's Seminole facility to Fabrinet. The transition began in October 2022 and substantially completed in the beginning of 2023, whereupon the Company no longer manufactures its products.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company completed a divestiture of certain subsidiaries in Asia (the \"Asia Sale\"). The divestiture allows DZS to focus on the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA), and Australia/New Zealand (ANZ) regions that are strategically aligned with the technology and acquisition investments made over the past several years.\n\n(b) Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 3 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete", " financial statements. These financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and notes thereto included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) on August 13, 2024. For a complete description of what the Company believes to be the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nOperating results of subsidiaries divested in conjunction with the Asia Sale were classified as discontinued operations in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for all periods presented. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale of the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.\n\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the current interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the current year or any other period.\n\n(c) Risks and Uncertainties\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.\n\nWe continue to be exposed to macroeconomic pressures in the post-COVID-19 environment, including concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment. We have seen improvement in our supply chain in 2024 as supply chain pricing, freight and logistics costs, product and component availability, and extended lead-times which were a challenge in prior years begin to alleviate. We expect elevated costs for components and expedite fees to further improve throughout 2024.\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(d) Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n\n(e) Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nThe following table presents revenues by product technology (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nAccess Networking Infrastructure Cloud Software & Services\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n20,232 $ 7,435 27,667 $\n\nThe following table present revenues by geographical concentration (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nAmericas Europe, Middle East, Africa Asia\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n$\n\n15,957 $ 10,823 887 27,667 $\n\n(f) Concentration of Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, accounts receivable, and contract assets. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash consist of financial deposits and money market accounts that are principally held with various domestic and international financial institutions with high credit standing. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash accounts in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insured limits.\n\nThe Company\u2019s customers include competitive and incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive access providers, internet service providers, wireless carriers and resellers serving these markets. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Allowances are maintained for credit losses based upon the expected collectability of accounts receivable using historical loss rates adjusted for customer- specific factors and current economic conditions. The Company determines historical loss rates on a rational and systematic basis. The Company performs periodic assessments of its customers\u2019 liquidity and financial condition through analysis of information obtained from credit rating agencies, financial statement review and historical and current collection trends.\n\nActivity under the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses consists of the following (in thousands):\n\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nBalance at beginning of period Charged to expense, net of recoveries Foreign currency exchange impact\n\nBalance at end of period\n\n$\n\n$\n\n4,282 $ (161) (11) 4,110 $\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 13% of net revenue.

Here\u2019s how these projections impact deferred tax assets:\n\n### 1. **Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets**\n   - **More-Likely-Than-Not Standard**: Deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits that a company expects to realize when it has sufficient taxable income to offset them. According to accounting standards (e.g., ASC 740), a company must assess whether it is \"more likely than not\" that it will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize these assets.\n   - **Assessment of Future Income**: If future income projections indicate strong profitability, the company may conclude that it is likely to realize its deferred tax assets, leading to the recognition of these assets on the balance sheet without a valuation allowance. Conversely, if projections show insufficient future income, the company may need to establish a valuation allowance against some or all of the DTAs.\n\n### 2. **Impact on Valuation Allowances**\n   - **Adjustment of Valuation Allowances**: Future income projections can lead to adjustments in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. If management anticipates increased future taxable income due to strategic initiatives, market conditions, or economic recovery, it may reduce the valuation allowance, thereby increasing the recognized deferred tax assets.\n   - **Negative vs. Positive Evidence**: Management evaluates both positive and negative evidence when assessing future income projections. If negative evidence (e.g., historical losses, adverse market conditions) outweighs positive evidence (e.g., new contracts, market expansion), the company may need to increase the valuation allowance, reducing the recognized DTAs.\n\n### 3. **Sensitivity to Changes in Projections**\n   - **Volatility of Projections**: Future income projections are inherently uncertain and can be influenced by various factors, including market conditions, competition, regulatory changes, and economic factors. Significant changes in these projections can lead to volatility in the valuation of deferred tax assets.\n   - **Periodic Reassessment**: Companies must periodically reassess their future income projections and the realizability of deferred tax assets. This reassessment may result in adjustments to the DTAs and valuation allowances, impacting the financial statements and tax expense recognized in a given period.\n\n### 4. **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Projections**\n   - **Different Impacts Based on Time Horizon**: Short-term projections may provide a more immediate view of taxable income, while long-term projections may be influenced by strategic business plans and market trends. Companies often use a combination of both to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets, considering that certain DTAs may not be realized until later periods.\n   - **Long-Term Growth Potential**: If a company forecasts significant long-term growth, it may justify the recognition of deferred tax assets that would otherwise be considered unrealizable in the short term.\n\n### 5. **Regulatory and Tax Law Considerations**\n   - **Changes in Tax Regulations**: Future income projections must also take into account potential changes in tax laws or regulations that could affect the utilization of deferred tax assets. For instance, changes in tax rates or the introduction of new tax incentives can impact future taxable income and, consequently, the realizability of DTAs.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, future income projections are critical in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets. They influence whether a company can recognize these assets on its balance sheet or if a valuation allowance is necessary. Management's assessment of future taxable income, the balance of positive and negative evidence, and the inherent uncertainty of projections all play a significant role in the valuation and accounting treatment of deferred tax assets. Regular reassessment of these projections ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the company\u2019s tax position and potential benefits."}, {"question": "What key factors matter for unaudited financials under U.S. GAAP amid ongoing economic pressures?", "ground_truth": "The key factors for unaudited financials under U.S. GAAP amid ongoing economic pressures include the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, exposure to macroeconomic pressures such as energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment.

Here are the critical factors:\n\n### 1. **Continuity of Operations**\n   - **Going Concern Assumption**: Companies must assess their ability to continue as a going concern for at least the next 12 months. If there are substantial doubts about the company\u2019s ability to continue, this must be disclosed, and management needs to consider the implications for financial statement preparation.\n\n### 2. **Revenue Recognition**\n   - **Adherence to ASC 606**: Companies must follow the revenue recognition principles outlined in ASC 606, which requires recognizing revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to customers. This includes considerations for variable consideration, performance obligations, and the timing of revenue recognition, especially in uncertain economic environments.\n\n### 3. **Estimates and Assumptions**\n   - **Use of Estimates**: Preparing unaudited financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. These estimates should be reviewed regularly, especially in volatile economic conditions, as actual results may differ from these estimates significantly.\n   - **Impairment Assessments**: Companies must evaluate their assets for impairment, particularly goodwill and long-lived assets, if economic pressures indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\n### 4. **Cost Management and Expense Recognition**\n   - **Matching Principle**: Expenses should be recognized in the same period as the revenues they help to generate. Companies need to ensure that they are accurately matching expenses to revenues, especially during periods of economic uncertainty when costs may fluctuate.\n   - **Variable Costs and Fixed Costs**: Understanding the impact of ongoing economic pressures on variable and fixed costs is essential for accurate expense reporting.\n\n### 5. **Disclosure Requirements**\n   - **Transparency in Financial Statements**: U.S. GAAP requires disclosures that provide relevant information to users of financial statements. This includes significant accounting policies, risks, uncertainties, and any changes in estimates related to economic conditions.\n   - **Subsequent Events**: Companies must disclose any significant events occurring after the reporting period but before the financial statements are issued that could impact the financial position or results of operations.\n\n### 6. **Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n   - **Assessment of Liquidity**: Companies must evaluate their liquidity position, including cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. This assessment is crucial in light of economic pressures that may affect cash flow stability.\n   - **Debt Covenants and Compliance**: Companies should monitor compliance with debt covenants and other financial obligations, as economic pressures may make it challenging to meet these requirements.\n\n### 7. **Tax Considerations**\n   - **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities**: Companies need to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets in light of current and projected future income. Economic pressures may impact taxable income forecasts, potentially leading to the need for valuation allowances.\n   - **Changes in Tax Regulations**: Any changes in tax laws or regulations that could affect the company's tax position should be considered and disclosed.\n\n### 8. **Impact of Macroeconomic Factors**\n   - **Inflation and Supply Chain Issues**: Companies should evaluate how inflation, supply chain disruptions, and other macroeconomic factors impact their financial performance and position. This includes assessing the impact on costs, pricing strategies, and demand for products and services.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, key factors that matter for unaudited financials under U.S. GAAP amid"}, {"question": "Why are docs vital for a claim extension due to Force Majeure?", "ground_truth": "The context does not specifically address why documents are vital for a claim extension due to Force Majeure.", "contexts": [" 15.1.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future net undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. If this assessment indicates that the cost of an intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows or other comparable market valuations of the entity or technology acquired over the remaining amortization period, the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset\u2019s fair value.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rate, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n53\n\nAny assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.\n\n(m) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process with step one requiring the comparison of the reporting unit's estimated fair value with the carrying amount of its net assets. If necessary, step two of the impairment test determines the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded when the reporting unit's recorded net assets exceed its fair value. In 2023, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date from October 31 to December 31. The Company believes this new date is preferable as it better aligns with the approval timeline for the Company\u2019s annual operating plan, which includes key inputs and assumptions used to assess the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units.\n\nIn the application of impairment testing, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates, market multiples, and other variables. Actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates.\n\n(n) Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method, which requires the identification of the acquirer, the determination of the acquisition date and the allocation of the purchase price paid by the acquirer to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their expected useful lives. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\n\n(o) Stock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date of the awards based on the estimated fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of restricted stock units based on the Company\u2019s stock price on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options, which is affected by the Company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the Company's expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. The expected stock price volatility is based on the weighted average of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company's stock options. The expected term of options granted is determined based on SAB 107 simplified method. Risk- free interest rates reflect the yield on zero-coupon United States Treasury securities.\n\nThe Company amortizes the value of the stock-based compensation to expense using the straight-line method. The value of the award is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n\n(p) Income Taxes\n\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that"], "metadata": [{"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/DZSI_10-K_1723507200.pdf", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/20/DZSI_10-K_1723507200.pdf"}], "response": "If an asset's value exceeds its future cash flows, it indicates that the asset may be impaired. In accounting terms, this situation typically leads to the following actions:\n\n### 1. **Impairment Testing**\n   - **Assessment of Recoverability**: Companies must conduct an impairment test to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable. This involves comparing the asset's carrying value (book value) to its estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the carrying amount exceeds the future cash flows, the asset is considered impaired.\n\n### 2. **Recording an Impairment Loss**\n   - **Reduction of Asset Value**: If the asset is deemed impaired, the company must record an impairment loss. This loss is recognized in the income statement and reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is typically determined using discounted cash flows or other valuation methods.\n   - **Impact on Financial Statements**: Recording an impairment loss affects both the balance sheet (by reducing the asset's value) and the income statement (by increasing expenses, which can lower net income).\n\n### 3. **Future Cash Flow Estimates**\n   - **Reevaluation of Cash Flows**: After recognizing an impairment loss, companies should continue to monitor the asset for changes in future cash flow estimates. If conditions improve and future cash flows are expected to exceed the carrying value, the asset may be reassessed for possible reversal of impairment in accordance with relevant accounting standards.\n\n### 4. **Disclosure Requirements**\n   - **Transparency in Financial Reporting**: Companies are required to disclose information related to impairment losses in their financial statements. This includes the nature of the asset, the reasons for the impairment, and the method used to determine fair value. This transparency is essential for stakeholders to understand the impact of the impairment on the company's financial health.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, when an asset's value exceeds its future cash flows, it triggers an impairment assessment. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the company must record an impairment loss, reducing the asset's carrying value and impacting financial statements. Ongoing monitoring of future cash flows is necessary, as changes in circumstances may lead to a reassessment of the asset's value."}, {"question": "How do no stock options in 2023 impact stock comp expenses?", "ground_truth": "The context does not provide specific information on how the absence of stock options granted in 2023 impacts stock compensation expenses.", "contexts": [" Remaining Contractual Term\n\nOutstanding at the beginning of the period Granted Exercised Canceled/Forfeited Expired Outstanding at the end of the period\n\nVested and exercisable at the end of the period\n\n1,496 $ \u2014 (1 ) (44 ) (176 ) 1,275 1,139 $\n\n11.84 \u2014 12.08 16.49 11.70\n\n11.70\n\n11.13\n\n7.2 $\n\n6.25\n\n6.13 $\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the Company\u2019s closing stock price as of December 31, 2023 of $1.97 per share which would have been received by the option holders had the option holders exercised their options as of that date.

These variables include the Company\u2019s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, expected term of the awards, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The estimated expected term of options granted was determined based on SAB 107 simplified method because the Company does not have adequate historical data for newly issued stock options. Estimated volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company and the risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for the expected life of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and therefore used an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\n\nThe Company did not grant any stock options during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Here\u2019s how this situation can impact stock comp expenses:\n\n### 1. **Reduction in Stock-Based Compensation Expense**\n   - **Lower Expenses**: Since no new stock options were granted in 2023, the company will not incur additional stock-based compensation expenses associated with options for that year. This leads to a decrease in the overall stock comp expenses reported in the income statement for 2023.\n   - **Comparison to Previous Years**: In contrast to prior years where stock options were granted, the absence of new options may result in a significant reduction in stock comp expenses compared to those periods.\n\n### 2. **Impact on Total Stock-Based Compensation**\n   - **Composition of Compensation**: Stock-based compensation includes various types of equity awards, such as restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs), and stock options. If stock options are not granted, the company\u2019s stock comp expenses may still be influenced by other forms of equity compensation (e.g., RSUs or PSUs). The overall stock comp expense will reflect the remaining equity awards being vested or granted.\n   - **Focus on Other Equity Awards**: The company may need to rely more on other types of equity compensation to attract and retain employees, which could lead to an increase in expenses related to those awards if they are granted in lieu of stock options.\n\n### 3. **Future Implications**\n   - **Potential for Increased Future Expenses**: If the company decides to grant stock options in future years to compensate for the lack of options in 2023, it may result in higher stock comp expenses in those years as the expense for newly granted options will be recognized over their vesting periods.\n   - **Impact on Employee Incentives**: The absence of stock options may affect employee motivation and retention if employees value stock options as part of their compensation package. This could lead the company to consider alternative compensation strategies to maintain employee engagement and performance.\n\n### 4. **Unrecognized Compensation Costs**\n   - **Existing Options**: If the company had stock options granted in previous years that are still unvested, it will continue to recognize the related stock comp expenses for those options over their remaining vesting periods. The lack of new options does not eliminate the existing unrecognized compensation costs associated with previously granted options.\n\n### Summary\nIn summary, the absence of stock options granted in 2023 will lead to a reduction in stock-based compensation expenses for that year, impacting the overall composition of stock comp expenses. While it may decrease current expenses, it could have future implications regarding employee incentives and potential increases in stock comp expenses if options are granted in subsequent years. The company must also continue to account for any existing options granted in prior periods."}]
