            " Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-02 \"Codification Improvements\u2014Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements\", which removes various references to concepts statements from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This ASU is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects the new guidance will have an immaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements, and intends to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\", which expands disclosures in an entity\u2019s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026. The Company expects the new guidance will have an immaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements, and intends to adopt the guidance prospectively when it becomes effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\", which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements, and intends to adopt the guidance retrospectively when it becomes effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 \"Disclosure Improvements - Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update\n\nand Simplification Initiative\", which amends the disclosure or presentation requirements related to various subtopics in the FASB Accounting Standard Codification (the \"Codification\"). This ASU will become effective on the date the SEC removes the applicable disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, with early adoption prohibited. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not be become effective for any entity. The Company expects the new guidance will have an immaterial impact on its consolidated financial statements, and intends to adopt the guidance when it becomes effective.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 \"Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance\n\nProgram Obligations\", which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. To achieve that objective, the buyer should disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its supplier finance programs. The amendments in this update do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, except for the amendment on roll-forward information which is effective in fiscal year 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the guidance retrospectively during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, including a roll-forward of changes in those obligations, with immaterial impacts on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n70\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFLEX LTD.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nThe Company has four supplier finance programs, all of which have substantially similar characteristics, with various financial institutions that act as\n\nthe paying agent for certain payables of the Company. The Company established these programs through agreements with the financial institutions to enable more efficient payment processing to our suppliers while also providing our suppliers a potential source of liquidity to the extent they choose to sell their receivables to the financial institutions in advance of the receivables' due date. Our suppliers\u2019 participation in the programs is voluntary, the Company is not involved in negotiations of the suppliers\u2019 arrangements with the financial institutions to sell their receivables, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted by our suppliers\u2019 decisions to sell amounts under these programs. Under these supplier finance programs, the Company pays the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its participating suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices. All payment terms are short-term in nature and are not dependent on whether the suppliers participate in the supplier finance programs or if the suppliers elect to receive early payment from the financial institutions.

            " are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nRevenue - Variable Consideration and Associated Customer-Related Accruals for Pricing Adjustments - Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the Financial Statements\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nCertain of the Company\u2019s customer agreements include potential price adjustments which may result in variable consideration. These price adjustments include committed price reductions, material margins earned over the period that are contractually required to be paid to the customers, and other periodic pricing resets that may be refundable to customers. The Company recognizes estimates of this variable consideration that are not expected to result in a significant revenue reversal in the future, primarily based on the amount of potential refunds required by the contract, historical experience and other surrounding facts and circumstances.\n\nWe identified the recognition of variable consideration and the associated customer-related accruals for pricing adjustments as a critical audit matter due to the judgments necessary to determine when estimates of this variable consideration are no longer expected to result in a significant revenue reversal in the future. This required extensive audit effort and a higher degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the variable consideration and associated customer-related accruals for pricing adjustments.\n\n54\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to variable consideration and associated customer related accruals for pricing adjustments included the following, among others:\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls the Company has in place relating to reviewing customer contracts to identify price adjustment clauses, estimating variable consideration and assessing the reasonableness of customer related accrual balances.\n\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s accounting policy with respect to variable consideration, as well as its process for identifying contracts that include potential price adjustment clauses.\n\nWe selected a sample of contracts with customers that included potential price adjustment clauses and performed the following: \u2013 We read the customer contracts to develop an understanding of clauses that could give rise to variable consideration and evaluated whether\n\nthe Company\u2019s accounting conclusions with respect to those clauses were reasonable.\n\n\u2013 We obtained and tested the mathematical accuracy of the Company\u2019s calculations of customer related accruals and evaluated the Company\u2019s judgments regarding the amount of variable consideration that should be deferred. In making this evaluation we considered both the terms included in the customer contract and the Company\u2019s historical experience in settling amounts with the customer.\n\nIncome Taxes - US Valuation Allowance - Refer to Note 15 to the Financial Statements\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized. The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax assets. During fiscal year 2024, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the U.S. deferred tax assets are realizable. As a result, the Company released the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets of $461 million and recorded a corresponding net income tax benefit.\n\nWe identified as a critical audit matter management\u2019s determination that the positive evidence of the three-year trend of objective and verifiable taxable income and forecasts of continued taxable income outweighed the negative evidence of historical losses and volatility because of the judgment required by management to determine forecasted taxable income. This required a higher degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s forecasts of sufficient future taxable income.\n\nHow"

Our adjusted free cash flow is defined as cash from operations, less net purchases of property and equipment to present adjusted cash flows on a consistent basis for investors. Our adjusted free cash flow was $0.8 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.6 billion for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Adjusted free cash flow is not a measure of liquidity under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted free cash flows reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure of cash flows from operations as follows:\n\n50\n\nTable of Contents\n\nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n(In millions)\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities Purchases of property and equipment Proceeds from the disposition of property and equipment\n\nAdjusted free cash flow (1)\n\n$\n\n$\n\n1,326 $ (530) 25 821 $\n\n950 $ (635) 20 335 $\n\n(1) Fiscal year 2022 figures in the table may not foot exactly due to rounding.\n\nOur cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world. Liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of the business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances; however, any current restrictions are not material. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout the global organization. We believe that our existing cash balances, together with anticipated cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months and beyond.\n\nFuture liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, the timing of capital expenditures for new equipment, the extent to which we utilize operating leases for new facilities and equipment, and the levels of shipments and changes in the volume of customer orders.\n\nWe maintain a commercial paper program which provides short-term financing under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of March 31,\n\n2024.\n\nHistorically, we have funded operations from cash and cash equivalents generated from operations, proceeds from public offerings of debt securities,\n\nbank debt and lease financings. We may enter into debt and equity financings, sales of accounts receivable and lease transactions to fund acquisitions and anticipated growth as needed. During fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022, we received approximately $3.6 billion, $3.5 billion, and $1.6 billion, respectively, from other sales of receivables under our factoring programs. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the outstanding balance on receivables sold for cash was $0.8 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, under our accounts receivable factoring programs, which were removed from accounts receivable balances in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nHistorically we have been successful in refinancing and extending the maturity dates on our term loans and credit facilities. In July 2022, the Company entered into a new $2.5 billion credit agreement which matures in July 2027 and consists of a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with a sub- limit of $360 million available for swing line loans",
            " expense was $0.4 billion and relatively consistent with prior years. These additions were offset by a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.6 billion primarily driven by changes in net working capital as discussed below.\n\n45\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe believe net working capital is a key metric that measures our liquidity. Net working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.\n\nNet working capital increased by $1.6 billion to $5.2 billion as of March 31, 2023, from $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by a $0.9 billion increase in inventories due to strong demand, coupled with increased buffer stock to address continued component shortages and logistics constraints, clear-to build constraints and logistics challenges and increases in inventory pricing, an $0.8 billion decrease in bank borrowings and current portion of long-term debt due to debt repayments, a $0.4 billion increase in accounts receivable, net and a $0.3 billion decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a $1.1 billion increase in deferred revenue and customer working capital advances due to advances from customers to offset required investments in inventory.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $0.6 billion during fiscal year 2023. This was primarily driven by $0.6 billion of capital expenditures for property and equipment to continue expanding capabilities and capacity in support of our expanding CEC, Industrial, Health Solutions and Automotive businesses.\n\nCash provided by financing activities was $2 million during fiscal year 2023. This was primarily driven by $0.7 billion of net proceeds received from\n\nthe sale of Nextracker Class A common stock through the IPO and $0.7 billion of proceeds from bank borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by $1.0 billion net cash for repayments of bank borrowings and long-term debt, and $0.3 billion of cash paid for the repurchase of our ordinary shares. Refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statement in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional details.\n\nFiscal Year 2022\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion during fiscal year 2022. The total cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from $0.9 billion of net income for the period plus $0.6 billion of non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, non-cash lease expense, restructuring and impairment charges, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation. Depreciation expense was $0.4 billion and relatively consistent with prior years. These additions were offset by a net change in our operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 billion primarily driven by changes in net working capital, partially offset by an increase in cash from other current liabilities of $1.1 billion primarily attributed to customer advances received.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $1.0 billion during fiscal year 2022.

            " named (and their role specified) in the arbitration rules. It may also be necessary to ensure, before so designating an institution in the Contract Data, that the institution is prepared to appoint or administer.\n\nFor major projects tendered internationally, it is desirable that the place of arbitration be situated in a country other than that of the Employer or Contractor. This country should have a modern and liberal arbitration law and should have ratified a bilateral or multilateral convention (such as the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards), or both, that would facilitate the enforcement of an arbitral award in the states of the Parties.\n\nIt may be considered desirable in some cases for other Parties to be joined into any arbitration between the Parties or for two or more pending arbitrations to be consolidated, thereby creating a multi-party arbitration. While the ICC Arbitration Rules address multi-party arbitration, such arbitration may in some cases be feasible only if the parties have included multi-party arbitration clauses in their contracts. Such clauses require skilful drafting, and usually need to be prepared on a case-by-case basis\n\n) a k n a L\n\nIt is not unusual that the arbitration of a complex dispute is concluded sometime after performance of the Contractor\u2019s obligations under the Contract have been completed, in which case it may not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances for any arbitral award which requires the payment of an amount by one Party to the other Party to be in the currencies of payment and in the proportions provided for under Sub-Clause 14.15 [Currencies of Payment]. For example, the Contractor may no longer have any need for local currency after completion of the Works; or the local currency may have declined in value in the interim or be a \u2018blocked currency\u2019 that, consequently, cannot be removed from the country concerned.\n\ni r\n\nS\n\n, r o y e v r u S y t i t\n\nn a u Q\n\n(\n\nH T A Y Z D E M A H O M L A\n\nI\n\n.\n\n55\n\nAdvisory Notes to Users of FIDIC Contracts Where the Project Uses Building Information Modelling Systems\n\nBuilding Information Modelling (BIM), is a process which is changing many elements of the design profession, the construction industry and, possibly, even the operation and maintenance of a facility.\n\nBIM is one of the digital data technologies used in all aspects of project planning, investigation, design, construction and operation. Digital data technologies include systems for: data acquisition; document management; design and process management; estimating, planning, and scheduling; contract management; performance management; and building information modelling.\n\nBIM has varying degrees of complexity ranging from rather isolated use of computer aided design tools to full sharing of models and information by the entire project team. Currently, BIM is more often used and better understood in developed countries, many of which are encouraging or even mandating its use to improve quality, accuracy and delivery times for projects as well as to provide cost savings. BIM has the potential to dramatically improve productivity in the construction industry and reduce operational costs of facilities as well.\n\nBIM is not a set of contract conditions; it is a mechanism to provide an environment where all parties have access to information relevant to their role in the design and construction of a project. Wherever possible, a combined (sometimes called federated or collaborative) model is developed for all parties to share, even if, as is often the case, various designers have used different computer aided design programs to develop their respective designs. Drawings and specifications are held in a common database accessible to everyone. These can be used for clash detection, coordination of designs, communication of changes, and construction sequencing.\n\nCoordination of goals and effort is essential and is generally achieved by a BIM Protocol and a BIM Execution Plan, both key documents to access and understand work in this environment. A designer needs to understand and work to the Levels of Design (or Detail) (LOD) that will be spelled out in these documents to ensure that there is sufficient detail at each level to allow all designs to progress efficiently and avoid unnecessary changes.\n\n) a k n a L\n\nBIM is founded on a team approach and successful projects utilising BIM encourage collaboration. FIDIC contracts are designed to be fair to all parties and are considered suitable for use with projects featuring the use of BIM - providing that the parties recognise the difference in approach and use the contract appropriately. This starts with proper planning and, unless an employer has appropriate expertise in house, they are well advised to retain an engineer who is appropriately qualified to assist them in the solicitation of interest, proposals, selection and negotiation of contracts with the selected project team. Legal advice is also necessary, of course, especially during the latter steps. The request for proposal (RFP) must clearly outline what the client\ufffd"

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\n\nNextracker Inc.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, Nextracker completed an IPO through a series of reorganization transactions that resulted in Nextracker\n\nhaving an Up-C structure.\n\nPrior to the IPO, TPG Rise held preferred units representing an interest of 17.37% in the LLC. This was presented as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on Flex\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. TPG Rise received a pro-rated 5% annual preferred dividend on its investment for the period prior to the IPO. In connection with the IPO, all of the preferred units of the LLC were automatically converted into an equal number of common units of the LLC. TPG Rise and the Flex subsidiaries holding LLC common units also subscribed for an equal number of non-economic, voting Class B common shares of Nextracker Inc. The common units of the LLC, together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock are exchangeable at any time at the option of the holder for shares of Nextracker Inc. Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or for cash, at the option of Nextracker Inc. and upon such exchange, a corresponding number of such holder's Class B common stock will be cancelled. Following the IPO, the noncontrolling interest in Nextracker comprise the Class A common stock of Nextracker (31.8% of Nextracker\u2019s total common stock) and 6.77% respectively of Nextracker\u2019s Class B common stock and the LLC\u2019s common units, held by TPG Rise.\n\nThe LLC also made a distribution in an aggregate amount of $175 million in advance of the IPO. With respect to such distribution, $50 million was distributed to Flex and the remaining $125 million to Flex's subsidiaries and TPG Rise, pro-rata in relation to their respective holdings. $22 million of the $125 million was distributed to TPG Rise in relation to their preferred units and this distribution is presented within income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations. The distribution was financed in part with net proceeds from a $150 million term loan under a credit agreement entered into by the LLC (the \u201c2023 Credit Agreement\u201d). Refer to note 9 for further discussion of our debt activities.\n\nFlex recorded the noncontrolling interest in Nextracker as 38.6% of Nextracker's post IPO book value, with a corresponding offset to additional paid-\n\nin capital of Flex. On a subsequent measurement basis, the carrying value is adjusted for earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023 and 2022, noncontrolling interest was $355 million and zero, and redeemable noncontrolling interest was zero and $78 million,\n\nrespectively. As a result of the IPO, the noncontrolling interest previously determined redeemable prior to the IPO did not exist as of March 31, 2023. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest was $240 million and $4 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n8.

        "ground_truth": "Contracts affect estimating variable consideration by requiring the estimation of potential refunds and price adjustments based on historical experience and other factors to avoid significant revenue reversals. Market conditions impact goodwill impairment as they influence judgments about projected cash flows and fair value, which can lead to material impairments if actual results differ from estimates.",
        "contexts": [
            " savings, committed price reductions, material margins earned over the period that are contractually required to be paid to the customers, rebates, refunds tied to performance metrics such as on-time delivery, and other periodic pricing resets that may be refundable to customers. We estimate the variable consideration related to these price adjustments as part of the total transaction price and recognize revenue in accordance with the pattern applicable to the performance obligation, subject to a constraint. We constrain the amount of revenues recognized for these contractual provisions based on our best estimate of the amount which will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. We determine the amounts to be recognized based on the amount of potential refunds required by the contract, historical experience and other surrounding facts and circumstances. Refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further details.\n\nInventory Valuation\n\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Our industry is characterized by rapid technological\n\nchange, short-term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand. We purchase our inventory based on forecasted demand and anticipated component shortages, and we estimate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand, and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers. If actual market conditions or our customers' product demands are less favorable\n\n39\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthan those projected, additional write downs may be required. In addition, unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers and/or changes in economic conditions may require additional write downs for inventories due to our customers' inability to fulfill their contractual obligations with regards to inventory procured to fulfill customer demand.\n\nCarrying Value of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in\n\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. Recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such asset groups are determined to be impaired, the impairment loss recognized, if any, is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value. Our judgments regarding projected cash flows for an extended period of time and the fair value of assets may be impacted by changes in market conditions, the general business environment and other factors including future developments of the remaining effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. To the extent our estimates relating to cash flows and fair value of assets change adversely we may have to recognize material impairment charges in the future.\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill\n\nmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit, which is measured based upon, among other factors, market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis. These approaches use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy and require us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views. Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables and credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill. Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further detail on our goodwill.\n\nNoncontrolling Interest\n\nInterests held by third parties in a consolidated majority-owned subsidiary are presented as noncontrolling interest, which represents the\n\nnoncontrolling equity holders' interest in the underlying net assets of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiary. Noncontrolling interest, where we may be required to repurchase the noncontrolling interest under a contractual redemption requirement, is reported in the consolidated balance sheets between liabilities and equity, as redeemable noncontrolling interest (\u201cRNCI\u201d).

Refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further detail on our goodwill.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, which will result in deductible amounts in future years, including net operating loss carry forwards. Based on estimates, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize these deferred income tax assets. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to increase or decrease our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recognized, resulting in additional or lesser income tax expense.\n\nWe are regularly subject to tax return audits and examinations by various taxing jurisdictions around the world, and there can be no assurance that the\n\nfinal determination of any tax examinations will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of a current or future examination, there could be a material adverse effect on our tax position, operating results, financial position and cash flows. Refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of our tax position.\n\n43\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales (amounts may not\n\nsum due to rounding). The financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" As further discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, as a result of the Spin-off in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the historical results of operations and balance sheets for periods prior to the Spin-off are presented as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements. For comparability purposes, the prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation.\n\nThe data below, and discussion that follows, represents our results from operations, and relative percentages.\n\nFiscal Year Ended March 31,\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nNet sales Cost of sales Restructuring charges\n\nGross profit\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses Intangible amortization Restructuring charges Operating income\n\nInterest expense Interest income Other charges (income), net Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates\n"
