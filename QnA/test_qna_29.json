            " our devices within their products, for eventual resale to consumers and also into other industrial applications.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nWe have prepared the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management\u2019s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. Our interim period operating results do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full fiscal year. In the opinion of the Company\u2019s management, the information presented herein reflects all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations, financial position, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective, or complex judgments by management. Those policies are inventory valuation, revenue recognition, income taxes, goodwill, and business combinations.\n\nOur business and operating results depend significantly on general market and economic conditions. The current global macroeconomic environment is volatile and continues to be adversely impacted by inflation, and a dynamic supply chain and demand environment, and signs of a weaker macroeconomic environment impacting capital expenditures across our served markets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment and other labor issues, decline in stock markets, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, and the current global economic challenges continue to put pressure on our business and operating results.\n\nWhile the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is lessening, the duration and severity of the impact of the pandemic on our business and results of operations in future periods remain uncertain. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including but not limited to the duration and spread of the pandemic and its variants in geographies where we do business, implementation and duration of local, state and federal issued public health orders in each jurisdiction where we operate or our customers and suppliers operate, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our supply chain and manufacturing partners, impact on our employees, and impact on regional and worldwide economies and financial markets in general, all of which are uncertain and not predictable. We assessed the potential impact that this pandemic has on our estimates as of April 1, 2023 and determined that there were no material impacts. However, due to the global supply chain constraint, we have had to incur incremental supply and procurement costs in order to fulfill demand from our customers. As of April 1, 2023, our inventory balance includes $10.8 million of incremental supply and procurement costs.\n\nWe are also continuously monitoring the current developments in the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine including the related export controls and resulting sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and other countries. Additional factors such as increased inflation, escalating energy costs, constrained raw material availability, and related cost increases could continue to impact the global economy and our business. Although the global implications of the Russian and Ukraine war are difficult to predict at this time, we do not presently foresee direct material adverse effects on our business.\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLUMENTUM HOLDINGS INC.

        "question": "What factors could lead to the requirement of recording additional inventory write-downs?",
        "ground_truth": "Factors that could lead to the requirement of recording additional inventory write-downs include actual market conditions being less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers being lower than estimates.",
        "contexts": [
            " upon our analysis and assumptions including, but not limited to, expected product lifecycles, product development plans and historical usage by product. Our product line management personnel play a key role in our excess review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product transitions and working with manufacturing to minimize excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventories previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.\n\nOur inventories are sensitive to technical obsolescence in the near term due to the use in industries characterized by the continuous introduction of new product lines, rapid technological advances, and product obsolescence. Based on certain assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time, we determine the amount of allowance for\n\n46\n\npotential inventory obsolescence. If these estimates and related assumptions or the market changes, we may be required to record additional reserves. Historically, actual results have not varied materially from our estimates.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nPursuant to Topic 606, our revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n\n\n\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\n\n\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\n\n\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\n\n\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\n\n\nrecognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nThe majority of our revenue comes from product sales, consisting of sales of Lasers and OpComms hardware products to our customers. Our revenue contracts generally include only one performance obligation. Revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers upon shipment or delivery of goods or rendering of services, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We have entered into vendor managed inventory (\u201cVMI\u201d) programs with our customers. Under these arrangements, we receive purchase orders from our customers, and the inventory is shipped to the VMI location upon receipt of the purchase order. The customer then pulls the inventory from the VMI hub based on its production needs. Revenue under VMI programs is recognized when control transfers to the customer, which is generally once the customer pulls the inventory from the hub.\n\nRevenue from all sales types is recognized at the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer adjusted for estimated variable consideration, if any. We typically estimate the impact on the transaction price for discounts offered to the customers for early payments on receivables or net of accruals for estimated sales returns. These estimates are based on historical returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. Actual returns could differ from these estimates. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. The product price as specified on the purchase order is considered the standalone selling price as it is an observable input that depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances.\n\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, which are collected by us from a customer and deposited with the relevant government authority, are excluded from revenue.\n\nOur revenue arrangements do not contain significant financing components as our standard payment terms are less than one year.\n\nIf a customer pays consideration, or we have a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional before we transfer a good or service to the customer, those amounts are classified as deferred revenue or deposits received from customers which are included in other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities when the payment is made or it is due, whichever is earlier.\n\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performances obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. Unsatisfied and partially unsatisfied performance obligations consist of contract liabilities and non-cancellable backlog. Non-cancellable backlog includes goods and services for which customer purchase orders have been accepted that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. A portion of our revenue arises from vendor managed inventory arrangements where the timing and volume of customer utilization is difficult to predict.\n\nWarranty\n\nHardware products regularly include warranties to the end customers such that the product continues to function according to published specifications. We typically offer a twelvemonth warranty for most of our products. However, in some instances depending upon the product, specific market, product line and geography in which we operate, and what is common in the industry, our"

We are subject to examination of income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. The timing of resolution and closure of these tax examinations is highly unpredictable. Although it is possible that certain ongoing tax examinations may be concluded within the next 12 months, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact to tax expense and net income from tax exams that could be resolved or closed within the next 12 months.

The terms of these Replacement Awards are substantially similar to the original NeoPhotonics equity awards. The Replacement Awards consisted of 0.4 million restricted stock units with a grant date fair value of $93.4 per share, which represents our closing stock price on the Closing date.

We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust our compensation cost based on this probability assessment. Our PSUs are subject to risk of forfeiture until performance and service conditions are satisfied and generally vest within three years.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, our board of directors approved a grant of 0.3 million PSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of $16.0 million to executive and non-executive employees as part of our revised Annual Incentive Plan. These PSUs are subject to performance targets and service conditions, with a vesting period of one year.

In November 2020, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA amends and augments the CCPA by expanding individuals\u2019 rights and the obligations of businesses that handle personal data. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states, including laws enacted in Colorado, Virginia, Utah, and Connecticut. Aspects of the CCPA, CPRA and these other laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear. The U.S. federal government also is contemplating federal privacy legislation. The effects of the CCPA, CPRA and these other state laws and regulations are potentially significant, however, and the impacts of these or other laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection continue to evolve in various jurisdictions, with existing laws and regulations subject to new and differing interpretations and new laws and regulations being proposed and adopted. It is possible that our practices may be deemed not to comply with those privacy and data protection legal requirements that apply to us now or in the future.\n\nFurther, following its exit from the the European Union, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation similar to the GDPR, including the UK Data Protection Act and legislation referred to as the UK GDPR, which provides for substantial penalties, similar to the GDPR. Additionally, the relationship between the United Kingdom in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, including with respect to regulation of data transfers between European Union member states and the United Kingdom.

Some uncertainty remains, however, as this adequacy determination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the UK GDPR, and other United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. We may find it necessary to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, each of which may require us to incur significant costs and expenses.\n\n81\n\nOur failure or perceived failure to comply with any of the foregoing legal and regulatory requirements could result in increased costs for our products, monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, government inquiries and investigations, legal claims, demands and litigation, and other liabilities. Furthermore, the legal and regulatory requirements that are applicable to our business are subject to change from time to time, which increases our monitoring and compliance costs and the risk that we may fall out of compliance. Additionally, we may be required to ensure that our suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with such laws or regulations, we could face sanctions for such noncompliance, and our customers may refuse to purchase our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nOur stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\n\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) under the symbol \u201cLITE\u201d.

            " of components or raw materials due to COVID-related restrictions or otherwise could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished goods inventory. There can be no assurance that the current supply chain impacts will not continue, or worsen, in the future. These supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nChanging technology and intense competition require us to continuously innovate while controlling product costs, and our failure to do so may result in decreased revenues and profitability.\n\nThe markets in which we operate are dynamic and complex, and our success depends upon our ability to deliver both our current product offerings and new products and technologies on time and at acceptable prices to our customers. The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, substantial capital investment, changes in customer requirements, continued price pressures and a constantly evolving industry. Historically, these pricing pressures have led to a continued decline of average selling prices across our business. The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and the accurate prediction of technology and market trends, and is further impacted by the disruptions caused by COVID-19 on our ability to continue with research and development activities and on our customers\u2019 abilities to introduce new products and offerings. The introduction of new products also often requires significant investment to ramp up production capacity, the benefit of which may not be realized if we are not successful in the production of such products or if customer demand does not develop as expected. Ramping of production capacity also entails risks of delays which can limit our ability to realize the full benefit of new product introductions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully, if at all, or on a timely basis. We also cannot assure you that potential markets for our new products will materialize on the timelines we anticipate, or at all, or that our technology will meet our customers\u2019 specifications. Our future performance will depend on the successful development, introduction, deployment and market acceptance of new and enhanced features and products that meet our customers\u2019 current and future needs. Future demand for our products is uncertain and will depend to a great degree on continued technological development and the introduction of new or enhanced products. If this does not continue, sales of our products may decline which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n62\n\nThe market for optical communications products in particular has matured over time and these products have increasingly become subject to commoditization. Both legacy competitors as well as new entrants, predominantly Asia-based competitors, have intensified market competition in recent years leading to pricing pressure. To preserve our revenues and product margin structures, we remain reliant on an integrated customer and market approach that anticipates end customer needs as Telecom and Datacom requirements evolve. We also must continue to develop more advanced, differentiated products that command a premium with customers, while conversely continuing to focus on streamlining product costs for established legacy products. If we fail to continue to develop enhanced or new products that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins, or over time are unable to adjust our cost structure to continue to competitively price more mature products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales; and the majority of our customers do not have contractual purchase commitments.\n\nWe have consistently relied on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and in certain of our markets, such as imaging and sensing and commercial lasers, this customer concentration is particularly acute. We expect that this customer concentration will continue in the future, and we expect that our financial performance in certain business lines and growth prospects will continue to depend in part on a small number of customers. Many of our customers purchase products under purchase orders or under contracts that do not contain volume or long-term purchase commitments. Therefore, these customers may alter their purchasing behavior with little or no notice to us for various reasons, including developing, or, in the case of our distributors, their customers developing, their own product solutions; choosing to purchase or distribute product from our competitors; incorrectly forecasting end market demand for their products; or experiencing a reduction in their market share in the markets for which they purchase our products. Some customers provide us with their expected forecasts for our products several months in advance, but these customers may decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place, including on short notice, or may experience financial difficulty which affects their ability to pay for products, particularly in light of the impacts of COVID-19 on their businesses and markets, and the impact of any such actions may be intensified given our dependence on a limited number of large customers. In addition, changes in the business requirements, vendor selection,"

The majority of our customers have historically been, and are currently, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) that incorporate our products into their products, which then address end-market applications. For example, we sell fiber optic components that network equipment manufacturers (\u201cNEMs\u201d) assemble into communications networking systems, which they sell to communications service providers, hyperscale cloud operators, and enterprises with their own networks. Similarly, many of our Lasers products customers incorporate our products into tools they produce, which are used for manufacturing processes by their customers. For imaging and sensing, we sell diode lasers to manufacturers of consumer electronics products for mobile, personal computing, gaming, and other applications, including to the automotive industry, who then integrate"

During fiscal 2022, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of our common stock as part of the share buyback program at an average price of $87.21 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $348.9 million. Since the appoval of the share buyback program by the board of directors, we have repurchased 7.7 million shares in aggregate at an average price of $81.66 per share for a total purchase price of $630.4 million. We recorded the $630.4 million aggregate purchase price as a reduction of retained earnings within our consolidated balance sheets. All repurchased shares were retired immediately. As of July 1, 2023, we have $569.6 million remaining under the share buyback program.\n\nThe price, timing, amount, and method of future repurchases will be determined based on the evaluation of market conditions and other factors, at prices determined to be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.

We invest in broad-based development for our employees in various ways such as skills- building programs, on-demand learning options, tuition reimbursement and tailored intern and mentoring programs, along with a suite of leadership development courses. In an effort to create more development opportunities for all employees, we are currently expanding our mentoring and leadership development programs, with added focus on development for diverse employees.\n\nWe believe we have made significant strides in attracting, engaging, and hiring a diverse group of early career employees through our internship program, our numerous sales and operations academies, and our \"pathways in technology\" program. We have also increased our focus on fostering internal mobility and providing more visibility and career advancement opportunities to our workforce through our internal communications platforms.\n\nWe gauge the efficacy of our programs, identify opportunities for improvement, and pursue solutions through tracking and analyzing data\n\nin a variety of ways, including conducting annual talent reviews and measuring our progress toward goals specified in our development, diversity and inclusion plans.\n\n8\n\nDiversity, Inclusion & Belonging\n\nWe believe that diversity stimulates creativity, spurs innovation and helps drive profitability, which is why we strive to create inclusive,\n\nwelcoming workplaces where everyone can feel at home, be their authentic selves and thrive. Realizing greater ethnic, racial and gender diversity across all levels of an organization is, and will continue to be, an ongoing journey. Our Diversity & Inclusion Steering Committee, comprised of a cross-functional team of senior executives and led by our Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, oversees and champions our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy. We aim for the highest standards of fairness and equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, promotions, job assignments and compensation (including undertaking periodic gender and race/ethnicity pay equity studies of our U.S., non-represented employees and making pay adjustments when warranted). Inclusive recruiting and outreach programs for diverse candidates, supportive and engaging employee resource groups, and management-led listening circles are among some of Lumen\u2019s initiatives to create greater diversity and belonging among our employees.\n\nPositive Corporate Culture\n\nOur employees are critical to Lumen's success and we believe creating a positive, inclusive culture is essential to attracting and retaining engaged employees. We want our employees to be proud to work with us and fully engaged to share in our purpose to further human progress through technology. Lumen\u2019s company culture program incorporates a wide variety of communication and training activities encouraging collaboration among our colleagues around the world. We measure the program\u2019s efficacy and identify opportunities for improvements through an engagement survey distributed approximately every six months.\n\nHealth & Wellness\n\nWe are committed to promoting the health, safety and well-being of our employees, business partners and global communities. We want all of our employees to thrive, and we regularly re-evaluate how to best support our employees\u2019 well-being through benefits and resources. We design our current benefit and wellness programs to drive engagement that positively impacts our culture, job satisfaction, recruiting and retention programs. We offer progressive employee benefits and enhancements that recognize the diverse needs of our people and their families.\n\nLabor Relations\n\nAt December 31, 2022, approximately 20% of our U.S. workforce was represented by a union, either the Communications Workers of\n\nAmerica or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Employees in four countries in Europe are represented by works councils or a representative body. We recognize the critical role that our supervisors and managers play in fostering a productive and respectful work environment, and we encourage employees to work directly with their supervisors, where possible, to efficiently and effectively resolve workplace concerns. We also respect our employees\u2019 rights to voluntarily establish and join unions and similar associations without unlawful interference. We strive to work collaboratively with the unions, councils and associations that represent our workers.\n\nCustomer Success\n\nOur customers range from individual households to global enterprises. Whether our network supports remote education to under-served\n\ncommunities or a multi-national work-from-home enterprise, all customers are impacted by the quality and reliability of our products and services. Understanding how each customer accesses and uses our products and services informs the type of customer engagement to best meet their"

We are subject to examination of income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. The timing of resolution and closure of these tax examinations is highly unpredictable. Although it is possible that certain ongoing tax examinations may be concluded within the next 12 months, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact to tax expense and net income from tax exams that could be resolved or closed within the next 12 months. Subject to audit timing and uncertainty, we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefit that would become recognized due to expiration of the statute of limitations and affect the effective tax rate to decrease by $1.9 million over the next 12 months.\n\nNote 13. Equity\n\nDescription of Lumentum Stock-Based Benefit Plans\n\nEquity Incentive Plan\n\nOn November 16, 2022, our stockholders approved amendments to the Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d) to (i) increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by an additional 0.9 million shares and (ii) to make certain other changes to reflect good corporate governance practices.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had 4.6 million shares subject to restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and performance stock units issued and outstanding under the 2015 Plan. These grants are performance-based, time-based or a combination of both and are expected to vest within four years. The fair value of these grants is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. As of September 30, 2023, 0.4 million shares of common stock under the 2015 Plan were available for grant.\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLUMENTUM HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (Unaudited)\n\nReplacement Awards\n\nIn connection with the merger with NeoPhotonics, we issued equity awards to certain NeoPhotonics employees, consisting of restricted stock units (the \u201cReplacement Awards\u201d) in exchange for their NeoPhotonics equity awards. The terms of these Replacement Awards are substantially similar to the original NeoPhotonics equity awards. The Replacement Awards consisted of 0.4 million restricted stock units with a grant date fair value of $93.4 per share, which represents our closing stock price on the Closing date. The total fair value of these Replacement Awards is $40.2 million, $3.5 million of which is attributable to employee services rendered through August 3, 2022, the merger Closing date, and was recognized as a component of the merger consideration and stock-based compensation in the consolidated statements of stockholders\u2019 equity. The remaining fair value of the Replacement Awards is recorded as stock-based compensation over the remaining vesting period. Refer to \u201cNote 4. Business Combinations.\u201d\n\nRestricted Stock Units\n\nRestricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) under the 2015 Plan are grants of shares of our common stock, the vesting of which is based on the requisite service requirement. Generally, our RSUs are subject to forfeiture and are expected to vest within four years. For annual refresh grants, RSUs generally vest ratably on an annual basis, or combination of annual and quarterly basis, over three years.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, our board of directors approved grants of 1.7 million RSUs, which primarily vest over three\n\nyears.\n\nPerformance Stock Units\n\nPerformance stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) under the 2015 Plan are grants of shares of our common stock that vest upon the achievement of certain performance and service conditions. We begin recognizing compensation expense when we conclude that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust our compensation cost based on this probability assessment. Our PSUs are subject to risk of forfeiture until performance and service conditions are satisfied and generally vest within three years.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, our board of directors approved a grant of 0.3 million PSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of $16.0 million to executive and non-executive employees as part of our revised Annual Incentive Plan. These PSUs are subject to performance targets and service conditions, with a vesting period of one year. The board of directors also approved a grant of 0.4 million PSUs with an aggregate grant date fair value of $19.3 million to certain executive officers and senior management.

            " required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are under audit by various tax authorities, which often do not agree with positions taken by us on our tax returns. Any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate.\n\nIncreasingly, countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cIRA\u201d) and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. These laws introduce new tax provisions and provide for various incentives and tax credits. The IRA applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations. While we are not currently expecting a material impact to our provision for income taxes by the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax under the IRA, it could materially affect our financial results, including our earnings and cash flow, if we become subject to this tax in the future.\n\nMany countries, and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d) have proposed implementing changes to existing tax laws, including a proposed global minimum tax of 15%, also known as Pillar Two, which was agreed to by more than 140 member jurisdictions in 2021 and adopted by European Union member states on December 12, 2022 to go into effect in 2024. Many countries are actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD\u2019s proposals. Any of these developments or changes in federal, state, or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rates, tax payments, or incentives will not be adversely affected by these or other developments or changes in law.\n\nOther countries also continue to enact and consider enacting new laws, which could increase our tax obligations, cause us to change the way we do business or our operations or otherwise adversely affect us. The foregoing items could increase our future tax expense, could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of foreign earnings, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur subsidiary in Thailand has been granted certain tax holidays by the Thailand government. As we do not currently meet the tax holiday requirements, income earned in Thailand is subject to the regular statutory income tax rate.\n\nWe are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax and other returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities globally, and we have a number of such reviews underway at any time. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and an adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such examinations, or changes in tax law or regulation impacting our effective tax rates, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n70\n\nOur operating results may be subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency.\n\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks with regard to our international operations which may affect our operating results. Since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. Although we price our products primarily in U.S. dollars, a portion of our operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. For example, a portion of our expenses are denominated in the U.K. pound sterling, Chinese yuan and Thai baht. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between these currencies and other currencies in which we collect revenues and/or pay expenses could have a material effect on our future operating results. Recently, our exposure to foreign currencies has increased as our non-U.S. manufacturing footprint has expanded. We continue to look for opportunities to leverage the lower cost of non-U.S. manufacturing, including the United Kingdom, Thailand, and Japan. While these geographies are lower cost than the U.S. and such concentration will in general lower our total cost to manufacture, this increase in concentration in non-U.S. manufacturing will also increase the volatility of our results. If the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates relative to certain other foreign currencies, it would increase our costs including the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of materials or services that we purchase in foreign currencies, as expressed in U.S. dollars. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could raise the relative cost of our products to non-U.S. customers, especially as compared",
            " to foreign competitors, and could reduce demand. Global economic volatility has had a significant impact on the exchange markets, which heightened this risk, and we expect the higher level of volatility in foreign exchange markets will likely continue.\n\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\n\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including supporting the development and introduction of new products, addressing new markets, engaging in strategic transactions and partnerships, improving or expanding our operating infrastructure or acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. Investments, partnerships and acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our operating and financial results. In March 2017, we issued and sold a total of $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes. In December 2019, we issued and sold a total of $1,050 million in aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes. In March 2022, we issued and sold a total of $861 million aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes. In June 2023, we issued and sold a total of $603.7 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes. We may in the future engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, increasing interest rates and other factors have resulted in volatility in the capital markets and less favorable financing terms. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\n\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.\n\nWe expect to appropriately scale our business, internal systems and organization, and to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. Growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and our anticipated growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain. The failure to effectively manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results, and even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will likely be expensive and complex. Our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets requires an effective planning and management process. In economic downturns, we must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during the downturn, as well as our future opportunities when the economy improves, remains intact. The failure to effectively manage our spending and operations could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\n\n71\n\nA widespread health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\n\nThe outbreak of a widespread health crisis, whether global in scope or localized in an area in which we, our customers or our suppliers do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Potential impacts on our operations and financial performance include:\n\n\n\nsignificant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines caused by, among other things, any temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products due to shutdown orders or financial hardship;\n\nworkforce constraints triggered by any applicable shutdown orders or stay-at-home policies;\n\n\n\ndisruptions to our third-party contract manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over our suppliers\u2019 workforce capacity, financial, or operational difficulties;\n\n\n\ndisruption in our own ability to produce and ship products;\n\n\n\nheightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services;\n\n\n\nrequirements to comply with governmental and regulatory responses such as quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce\u2019s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results;\n\n\n\ngeneral",

Further, our third-party service providers may have been and may be in the future subject to such attacks or otherwise may suffer security breaches or incidents. In addition, actions by our employees, service providers, partners, contractors, or others, whether malicious or in error, could affect the security of our systems and information. Further, a breach or compromise of our information technology infrastructure or that of our third-party service providers could result in the misappropriation of intellectual property, business plans, trade secrets or other information.

Moreover, new laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law, add to the complexity of our compliance obligations and increases our compliance costs.

While we work to safeguard our internal network systems and validate the security of our third-party service providers to mitigate these potential risks, including through information security policies and employee awareness and training, there is no assurance that such actions have been or will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches or incidents. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to social engineering and other cybersecurity attacks, and these attacks may become more prevalent with substantial portion of our workforce being distributed geographically, particularly given the increased remote access to our networks and systems as a result. Further, our third-party service providers may have been and may be in the future subject to such attacks or otherwise may suffer security breaches or incidents. In addition, actions by our employees, service providers, partners, contractors, or others, whether malicious or in error, could affect the security of our systems and information. Further, a breach or compromise of our information technology infrastructure or that of our third-party service providers could result in the misappropriation of intellectual property, business plans, trade secrets or other information. Additionally, while our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and information systems, accidental or willful security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities or our information systems could lead to unauthorized access to, or misappropriation, disclosure, or other processing of proprietary, confidential and other information. Moreover, laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law, add to the complexity of our compliance obligations and increases our compliance costs. Although we have established internal controls and procedures intended to comply with such laws and regulations, any actual or alleged failure to fully comply could result in significant penalties and other liabilities, harm to our reputation and market position, business and financial condition.\n\n73\n\nDespite our implementation of security measures, our systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage from these or other types of attacks, errors or acts of omissions. In addition, our systems may be impacted by natural disasters, terrorism or other similar disruptions. Any system failure, disruption, accident or security breach or incident affecting us or our third-party service providers could result in disruptions to our operations and loss or unavailability of, or unauthorized access or damage to, inappropriate access to, or use, disclosure or other processing of confidential information and other information maintained or otherwise processed by us or on our behalf. Any actual or alleged disruption to, or security breach or incident affecting, our systems or those of our third-party partners could cause significant damage to our reputation, lead to theft or misappropriation of our intellectual property and trade secrets, result in claims, investigations, and other proceedings by or before regulators, and claims, demands and litigation, legal obligations or liability, affect our relationships with our customers, require us to bear significant remediation and other costs and ultimately harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or mitigate damage caused by disruptions or security breaches or incidents. Our costs incurred in efforts to prevent, detect, alleviate or otherwise address cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and such efforts may not be successful. All of these costs, expenses, liability and other matters may not be covered adequately by insurance and may result in an increase in our costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on economically feasible terms, or at all. Insurers may also deny us coverage as to any future claim. Any of these results could harm our financial condition, business and reputation.\n\nOur revenues, operating results, and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, which makes predicting financial results difficult.\n\nSpending on optical communication and laser products is subject to cyclical and uneven fluctuations, which could cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably. It can be difficult to predict the degree to which end-customer demand and the seasonality and uneven sales patterns of our OEM partners or other customers will affect our business in the future, particularly as we or they release new or enhanced products. We are also subject to changes in buying patterns among our OEM partners and other customers, including unpredictable changes in their desired inventory levels. Further, if our revenue mix changes, it may also cause results to differ from historical seasonality. Accordingly, our quarterly and annual revenues, operating results, cash flows, and"

            "Overview\n\nWe are an industry-leading provider of optical and photonic products defined by revenue and market share, addressing a range of end-market applications including Optical Communications (\u201cOpComms\u201d) and Commercial Lasers (\u201cLasers\u201d) for manufacturing, inspection and life-science applications.\n\nWe have two operating segments, OpComms and Lasers. The two operating segments were primarily determined based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.\n\nWe believe the global markets in which Lumentum participates have fundamentally robust, long-term trends that will increase the need for our photonics products and technologies. We believe the world is becoming more reliant on ever-increasing amounts of data flowing through optical networks and data centers. Lumentum\u2019s products and technology enable the scaling of these optical networks and data centers to higher capacities. We expect that the accelerating shift to digital and virtual approaches to all aspects of work and life will continue into the future. Virtual meetings, video calls, and hybrid in- person and virtual environments for work and other aspects of life will continue to drive strong needs for bandwidth growth and present dynamic new challenges that our technology addresses. As manufacturers demand higher levels of precision, new materials, and factory and energy efficiency, suppliers of manufacturing tools globally are turning to laser-based approaches, including the types of lasers Lumentum supplies. Laser-based 3D sensing and LiDAR for security, industrial and automotive applications are rapidly developing markets. The technology enables computer vision applications that enhance security, safety, and new functionality in the electronic devices that people rely on every day. The use of LiDAR and in-cabin 3D sensing in automobile and delivery vehicles over time significantly adds to our long-term market opportunity. Frictionless and contactless biometric security and access control is of increasing focus globally given the world\u2019s experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we expect 3D-enabled machine vision solutions to expand significantly in industrial applications in the coming years.\n\nTo maintain and grow our market and technology leadership positions, we are continually investing in new and differentiated products and technologies and customer programs that address both nearer-term and longer-term growth opportunities, both organically and through acquisitions, as well as continually improving and optimizing our operations. Over many years, we have developed close relationships with market leading customers. We seek to use our core optical and photonic technology and our volume manufacturing capability to expand into attractive emerging markets that benefit from advantages that optical or photonics-based solutions provide.\n\nMergers and Acquisitions\n\nNeoPhotonics Merger\n\nOn August 3, 2022 (the \u201cClosing date\u201d), we completed our merger with NeoPhotonics Corporation (\u201cNeoPhotonics\u201d). The addition of NeoPhotonics expands our opportunities in some of the fastest growing markets for optical components used in cloud and telecom network infrastructure. We expect the integrated company to be better positioned to serve the needs of a global customer base who are increasingly utilizing photonics to accelerate the shift to digital and virtual approaches to work and life, the proliferation of IoT, 5G, and next-generation mobile networks, and the transition to advanced cloud computing architectures.\n\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, NeoPhotonics stockholders received $16.00 per share for each of the NeoPhotonics common stock they own at the Closing date. As a result, we paid $867.3 million of cash consideration to shareholders of NeoPhotonics on the Closing date.\n\nAs contemplated by the Merger Agreement, on January 14, 2022, Lumentum and NeoPhotonics entered into a credit agreement where Lumentum agreed to make term loans (\u201cloans\u201d) to NeoPhotonics in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $50.0 million to help fund capital expenditures and increase working capital associated with NeoPhotonics\u2019 growth plans. During fiscal 2022, we funded a $30.0 million loan request to NeoPhotonics. On August 1, 2022, we funded an additional $20.0 million loan request to NeoPhotonics. The interest was payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month. The loans would have matured on January 14, 2024 unless earlier repaid or accelerated. The $50.0 million loans in aggregate were included as part of the total purchase price consideration.\n\n43\n\nWe paid $22.6 million cash consideration to shareholders of NeoPhotonics for the vested and accelerated NeoPhotonics equity awards, of which $13",

The remaining $9.0 million related to the payment of change-in-control provisions for certain executives, which were recognized as post-combination expenses due to the dual-trigger nature of the arrangements. Additionally, we issued replacement equity awards (the \u201cReplacement Awards\u201d) in settlement of certain NeoPhotonics equity awards that did not become vested at the Closing date, with the total fair value of $40.2 million based on our closing stock price on the Closing date. The portion of Replacement Awards attributed to pre- merger service was recorded as part of the consideration transferred, which was $3.5 million.\n\nThe total transaction consideration of $934.4 million was funded by the cash balances of the combined company. We also recorded $22.1 million of merger-related costs, representing professional and other direct acquisition costs. Of the $22.1 million of merger-related costs, $8.3 million was incurred in fiscal year 2022, and $1.2 million and $13.8 million was incurred during the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, which was recorded as selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nRefer to \u201cNote 4.

We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions.\n\nCash Flows\n\nOur balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by $52.5 million from $436.7 million as of June 29, 2024 to $489.2 million as of September 28, 2024. The increase in cash and cash equivalents during the three months ended September 28, 2024 was due to cash from financing activities of $60.0 million and cash from operating activities of $39.6 million, offset by cash used in investing activities of $47.1 million.\n\nOperating Cash Flow\n\nCash from operating activities was $39.6 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024, which reflects a net loss of $82.4 million, offset by non-cash items of $112.1 million and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $9.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable of $32.6 million primarily due to higher inventory purchases and capital expenditures and an increase in income tax liabilities of $7.2 million primarily due to income tax provision for the three months ended September 28, 2024, offset by an increase of $16.6 million in prepayments and other current and non-current assets related mainly to value-added-tax receivables driven by higher recent capital expenditures and inventory purchases, and a decrease of $9.7 million in accrued expenses and other current and non-current liabilities primarily due to payment of the net settlement amount of the Oclaro merger litigation.\n\nCash used in operating activities was $2.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reflects a net loss of $67.9 million and non- cash items of $89.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, offset by $24.3 million changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities were mainly driven by an increase in inventories of $16.8 million primarily due to purchases made to support our manufacturing transition and lower shipments than expected, a decrease in accounts payable of $28.0 million primarily due to lower purchases from our contract manufactures and linearity of payments, and a decrease in income taxes of $19.9 million due to annual income tax payment in Japan, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $26.1 million due to lower revenue.\n\nInvesting Cash Flow\n\nCash used in investing activities of $47.1 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 was attributable to capital expenditures of $74.1 million, offset by net proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments of $26.8 million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $0.2 million.\n\nCash provided by investing activities of $17.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to the net proceeds from sales or maturities of short-term investments of $78.6 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $57.8 million and a $3.0 million payment for an intangible asset acquisition.\n\nFinancing Cash Flow\n\nCash from financing activities of $60.0 million during the three months ended September 28, 2024 was attributable to $76.5 million of proceeds from SMBC and Mizuho term loans and $0.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by tax payments related to net share settlement of restricted stock of $16.0 million, payment for an intangible asset acquisition holdback of $1.0 million and $0.4 million of principal payments on term loans.\n\nCash used in financing activities of $12.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to tax payments related to net share settlement of restricted stock of $12.9 million.\n\n52\n\nITEM 3.

            " Additionally, if we are found to be in violation of these laws, we could be subject to governmental fines or civil liability for damages resulting from such violations. These costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or operating results.\n\n35\n\nFrom time-to-time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cWEEE\u201d) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture. These regulations and similar legislation may require us to re-design our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials, which could have an adverse impact on the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or other similar effects. We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold, and we continuously monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has promulgated rules requiring disclosure regarding the use of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals. We may face challenges with government regulators and our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently make any required determination that the metals used in our products are conflict free. Complying with these disclosure requirements involves substantial diligence efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products and may require third-party auditing of our diligence process. These efforts may demand internal resources that would otherwise be directed towards operations activities.\n\nSince our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals used in our products. Additionally, if we are unable to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are determined to be conflict free, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products which could materially impact our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations to our collection and other processing of personal data of our employees, customers and others. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent modifications and updates and require ongoing supervision. For example, the European Union adopted a General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) that became effective in May 2018, and has established new, and in some cases more stringent, requirements for data protection in Europe, and which provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance. Brazil passed the General Data Protection Law that became effective in August 2020 to regulate processing of personal data of individuals, which also provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, California has the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. In November 2020, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA amends and augments the CCPA, including by expanding individuals\u2019 rights and the obligations of businesses that handle personal data. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in several other states. Aspects of the CCPA, CPRA and these other laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear. The U.S. federal government also is contemplating federal privacy legislation. The effects and impact of these or other laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in efforts to comply. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection continue to evolve in various jurisdictions, with existing laws and regulations subject to new and differing interpretations and new laws and regulations being proposed and adopted. It is possible that our practices may be deemed not to comply with those privacy and data protection legal requirements that apply to us now or in the future.\n\nFurther, the United Kingdom has implemented legislation similar to the GDPR, including the UK Data Protection Act and legislation referred to as the UK GDPR, which provides for substantial penalties, similar to the GDPR. Aspects of United Kingdom data protection law remains unclear following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, including with respect to data transfers between the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the UK GDPR, and other United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws",

We may find it necessary to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, each of which may require us to incur significant costs and expenses.\n\n36\n\nOur failure or perceived failure to comply with any of the foregoing legal and regulatory requirements, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security could result in increased costs for our products, monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, government inquiries, investigations and other legal proceeds, legal claims, demands and litigation and other obligations and liabilities. Furthermore, the legal and regulatory requirements that are applicable to our business are subject to change from time to time, which increases our monitoring and compliance costs and the risk that we may fall out of compliance. Additionally, we may be required to ensure that our suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with such laws or regulations, we could face sanctions for such noncompliance, and our customers may refuse to purchase our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nOur stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\n\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) under the symbol \u201cLITE\u201d. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control and may often be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. These include:\n\n\n\ngeneral economic and market conditions and other external factors;\n\n\n\nchanges in global economic conditions, including those resulting from trade tensions, rising inflation, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates;\n\n\n\nspeculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position;\n\n\n\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\n\n\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\n\n\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\n\n\na shift in our investor base;\n\n\n\nthe financial performance of other companies in our industry, and of our customers;\n\n\n\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions, including market conditions in the semiconductor industry;\n\n\n\npandemics and similar major health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\n\n\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\n\n\ncredit market fluctuations which could negatively impact our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\n\n\nchanges in governmental regulation including taxation and tariff policies;\n\n\n\nchanges in global political tensions that may affect business with our customers;\n\n\n\nannouncements by us, competitors, customers, or our contract manufacturers of significant acquisitions or dispositions, strategic alliances or overall movement toward industry consolidations among our customers and competitors;\n\n\n\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\n\n\nchanges in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\n\n\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\n\n\ndifferences, whether actual or perceived, between our corporate social responsibility and ESG practices and disclosure and investor expectations;\n\n\n\nlitigation or disputes in which we may become involved;\n\n\n\noverall market fluctuations;\n\n\n\nissuances of our shares upon conversion of some or all of the convertible notes;\n\n\n\nsales of our shares by our officers, directors, or significant stockholders; and\n\n37\n\n\n\nthe timing and amount of share repurchases, if any\n\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nServicing our existing and future indebtedness, including the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes (collectively referred to as \u201cthe convertible notes\u201d) may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the convertible notes and our current and future indebtedness may limit our operating flexibility or otherwise affect our business.\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness under the convertible notes, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the convertible notes or upon any fundamental change if holders of the applicable series of the convertible notes require us to repurchase their convertible"

We also incurred $6.8 million of merger-related costs during the fiscal second quarter of 2024, representing professional and other direct acquisition costs, which was recorded as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Refer to \u201cNote 4. Business Combinations\u201d in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe evaluate strategic opportunities regularly and, where appropriate, may acquire additional businesses, products, or technologies that are complementary to, or broaden the markets for our products. We believe we have strengthened our business model by expanding our addressable markets, customer base and expertise, diversifying our product portfolio and fortifying our core businesses from acquisitions as well as through organic initiatives.\n\n44\n\nSupply Chain Constraints and Inventory Management\n\nOur business and our customers\u2019 businesses have been negatively impacted by worldwide logistics and supply chain issues, including constraints on available cargo capabilities and limited availability of once broadly available supplies of both raw materials and finished components. COVID-19 also created dynamics in the semiconductor component supply chains that have led to shortages of the types of components we and our customers require in our products. Although the supply chain constraints improved in the latter half of fiscal 2023, they may impact our ability to supply our products to our customers and may reduce our revenue and profit margin if these shortages happen again in the future. In addition, if our customers are unable to procure needed semiconductor components, their demand for our products will decrease. Due to the global supply chain constraints, we had to incur incremental supply and procurement costs in order to increase our ability to fulfill demands from our customers.\n\nIn addition, in response to component shortages, certain of our customers accumulated inventory that they are now managing down as supply conditions improve. Accordingly, customer orders have declined in recent periods and certain customers have not taken the shipments we had originally projected due to their inventory management. As customers manage their inventory down, our revenue has declined and our margins are adversely impacted as we are not able to fully recover costs, such as underutilized manufacturing capacity, associated with the forecasted demand and we may incur excess and obsolescence charges from unsold inventory. We expect this trend to continue to impact our business during the calendar year 2024.\n\nFor more information on risks associated with supply chain constraints and customer inventory management, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in\n\nItem 1A of Part II of this report.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur condensed and consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d). We also consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Goodwill and Intangible Assets - Impairment Assessment\n\nInventory Valuation Revenue Recognition Income Taxes Business Combinations\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended July 1, 2023 provides a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nComparative prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the new segment structure and segment profitability measure.

As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the markets in which we participate. All aspects of our forecasts depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Our business and operating results depend significantly on general market and economic conditions. The current global macroeconomic environment is volatile and continues to be significantly and adversely impacted by inflation and a dynamic demand environment. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding inflation, banking instability, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, stock market volatility, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the on-going Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas war, and China-Taiwan relations), the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.\n\nAdverse changes to and uncertainty in the global economy has affected industries in which our customers operate and has resulted in decreases in the rate of demand, consumption or use of certain of our customers\u2019 products which, in turn, has resulted in, and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products, revenue fluctuations, increased price competition for our products, and increased the risk of excess and obsolete inventories as well as higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue. Additionally, customers who had built up large inventories when supply chains were tight are now bringing down inventories as supply constraints are easing and in some cases these customers have delayed projected shipments. These losses or delays of orders have harmed our revenue and profitability and future losses or delays may further harm our results of operations. The impact of economic challenges on the global financial markets could further negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our customers, the solvency of our key suppliers or the ability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. Further, supply chain disruptions have led and may continue to lead to increased costs and have harmed and may continue to harm our ability to meet customer demand, adversely affecting our revenue and profitability. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, our prospects for growth may be negatively impacted, and we may experience material and adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for raw materials, packages and components, and any failure or delay by these suppliers in meeting our requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe purchase raw materials, packages and components from a limited number of suppliers, who are often small and specialized. Additionally, some of our suppliers are our sole sources for certain materials, equipment and components. We depend on the timely and continued supply and quality of the materials, packages and components that our suppliers supply to us. We have not entered into long-term agreements with many of these suppliers. We do not have a guarantee of supply from these suppliers and as a result, there is no assurance that we would be able to secure the equipment or components that we require, in sufficient quantity, quality and on reasonable terms. Our business and results of operations have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by this dependency. Alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any sole supplier will adversely affect our business are not feasible in all circumstances. If we were to lose any one of these or other critical sources, or there is as an industry-wide increase in demand for, or the discontinuation of, raw materials used in our products, it could be difficult for us, or we may be unable, to find an alternative supplier or raw material, in which case our operations could be adversely affected.\n\nSpecific concerns we periodically encounter with our sole suppliers or"

In conjunction with the TSA transaction, we paid $209 million in lender fees and $174 million in additional third-party costs.

        "ground_truth": "Unmet ESG expectations could negatively impact a company's reputation or materially harm its business. If a company fails to achieve its ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments, it could face criticism and damage to its reputation.

            " is an increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters both in the United States and globally. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain. If we are unable to comply with, or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply with such policies or provisions, or meet the requirements of our customers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Future compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as meeting related customer and investor expectations, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\n\nWe communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters, in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, on our website, in certain filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, for any revisions to them, or for our disclosures related to such matters, or for our policies and practices related to these matters. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by climate change regulations.\n\nIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations are mandatory in some cases, and have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate.\n\nWe may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, increased insurance premiums and deductibles, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide including with respect to environmental matters, securities laws, privacy and data protection, compliance with which could increase our expenses and harm our operating results.\n\nOur operations and our products are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing pollution and protection of human health and the environment in the jurisdictions in which we operate or sell our products. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, wastewater discharges and the handling and disposal of hazardous materials in our products. Our failure to comply with current and future environmental or health or safety requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs, including significant capital expenditures, to comply with such environmental laws and regulations and to clean up contaminated properties that we own or operate. Such clean-up or compliance obligations could result in disruptions to our operations. Additionally, if we are found to be in violation of these laws, we could be subject to governmental fines or civil liability for damages resulting from such violations. These costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or operating results.\n\nFrom time-to-time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), the\n\n33\n\nRestriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cRoHS\u201d) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (\u201cWEEE\u201d) enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from"

            " and change frequently. There is a risk that these laws or regulations may materially restrict our ability to deliver services in various international jurisdictions or expose us to the risk of fines, penalties or license revocations if we are determined to have violated applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, these laws or regulations may potentially impact our customers and result in foregone business or penalties to us if we fail to comply with any applicable sanctions or restrictions on our activities.\n\nMany non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to communications services are more restrictive than U.S. laws and regulations. We are subject to the GDPR of the European Union and the United Kingdom, as well as various other laws governing privacy rights, data protection and cybersecurity laws in other regions. These laws and\n\n28\n\nregulations continue to proliferate and evolve, are becoming more complex and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. Moreover, many countries are still in the early stages of providing for and adapting to a liberalized telecommunications market, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain licenses and conduct our operations.\n\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include: economic,\n\nsocial and political instability, with the attendant risks of terrorism, kidnapping, extortion, civic unrest, potential seizure or nationalization of assets; currency and exchange controls, repatriation restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including, without limitation, the matters outlined in Note 1\u2014Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \u2014 Foreign Currency; problems collecting accounts receivable; the difficulty or inability in certain jurisdictions to enforce contract or intellectual property rights; reliance on certain third parties with whom we lack extensive experience; supply chain challenges; and challenges in securing and maintaining the necessary physical and telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nOur operations and financial results could be impacted by changes in multilateral conventions, treaties, tariffs or other arrangements\n\nbetween or among sovereign nations, including most recently Brexit.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nOur significant debt levels expose us to a broad range of risks.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $10.4 billion of outstanding consolidated secured indebtedness, $10.1 billion of outstanding consolidated unsecured indebtedness (excluding (i) finance lease obligations, (ii) unamortized premiums, net and (iii) unamortized debt issuance costs) and $2.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nOur significant levels of debt and related debt service obligations could adversely affect us in several respects, including:\n\n\n\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives;\n\n\n\nhindering our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to plan for or react to changing market, industry, competitive or economic conditions;\n\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases (especially with respect to our variable rate debt);\n\n\n\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged companies;\n\n\n\nadversely impacting other parties\u2019 perception of Lumen, including but not limited to existing or potential customers, vendors, employees or creditors;\n\nmaking it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing or refinancing, including the risk that this could force us to sell assets or take other less desirable actions to raise capital; and\n\n\n\nincreasing the risk that we may not meet the financial or non-financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments, either of which could result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\n\nThe effects of each of these factors could be intensified if we increase our borrowings or experience any downgrade in our credit ratings or\n\nthose of our affiliates. Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, the current terms of our debt instruments and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments permit us or them to incur additional indebtedness.\n\n29\n\nWe expect to periodically require financing, and we cannot assure you we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are\n\nacceptable to us, or at all.\n\nWe expect to periodically require financing in the future to refinance existing indebtedness and potentially for other purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position, performance, credit ratings, and debt covenants, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by (i) general market conditions, such as disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign or corporate debt markets, geo-political instabilities, trade restrictions, pandemics, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad, and (ii) specific conditions in the communications"
