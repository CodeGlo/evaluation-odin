            " global components reportable segment, the Asia/Pacific reporting unit\u2019s goodwill was previously fully impaired.\n\nThe company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test annually and this test is used to both identify and measure impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, no impairment exists. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. For the purposes of the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The assumptions included in the income approach include forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital, perpetual growth rates, income tax rates, and long-term discount rates, among others, all of which require significant judgments by management. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company\u2019s forecasts. The company also reconciles its discounted cash flow analysis to its current market capitalization allowing for a reasonable control premium. As of the first day of the fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, the company\u2019s annual impairment testing did not indicate impairment at any of the company\u2019s reporting units.\n\nAs of the date of the company\u2019s 2024 annual impairment test, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 38%. Discount rates are one of the more significant assumptions used in the income approach. If the company increased the discount rates used by 100 basis points, the fair value of all reporting units would still exceed their carrying values by more than 24%.\n\nA decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company\u2019s businesses, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company\u2019s consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North American asset securitization program, other outstanding borrowings, and EMEA asset securitization program.\n\n56\n\n563,135 115,651 \u2014 223,659\n\n776,765 376,085 2,055,295\n\nIndex\n\nLeases\n\nThe company determines if a contract contains a lease at inception based on whether it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset. Substantially all of the company\u2019s leases are classified as operating leases. The company records operating lease right-of-use assets within \u201cOther assets\u201d and lease liabilities are recorded within \u201cOther liabilities\u201d and \u201cAccrued expenses\u201d in the consolidated balance sheets. Lease expenses are recorded within \u201cSelling, general, and administrative\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations. Operating lease payments are presented within \u201cOperating cash flows\u201d in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the net present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term starting on the commencement date. The company generally is not able to determine the rate implicit in its leases and, as such, applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the company\u2019s cost of borrowing for the relevant terms of each lease. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease terms may include an option to extend or terminate a lease if it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise such options. The company does not separate lease components from non-lease components, and also has elected not to record a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases which, at inception, have a term of twelve months or less. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\n\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\n\nThe assets and liabilities of international operations are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the monthly average exchange rates. Adjustments arising from the translation of the foreign currency financial statements of the company\u2019s international operations are reported as a component of \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive loss\u201d in the company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor foreign currency remeasurement from each local currency into the appropriate functional currency, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to functional currencies using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.

As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets, as well as those with greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors.\n\nWe are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations.\n\nOur ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. Many of our customers, resellers, partners, suppliers and manufacturers operate around the world. Operating in a global marketplace, we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and compliance and regulatory requirements.

If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and/or outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, except for land which is not depreciated. We capitalize any additions and improvements and expense maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three years. Our leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining lease term.\n\nLeases\n\nWe lease office space, data centers, and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2029. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and lease liabilities, and are included in other assets and other current and non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not have any finance leases in any of the periods presented.\n\nROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. The interest rate implicit in our operating leases is not readily available, and therefore, an incremental borrowing rate is estimated based on a hypothetical interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms, payments, and economic environments. ROU assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\n\nOur operating lease agreements may contain rent concession, rent escalation, and option to renew provisions. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we have the right to use the leased property. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. In addition, certain of our operating lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances from landlords. These allowances are accounted for as lease incentives and decrease our right-of-use asset and reduce lease expense over the lease term.\n\nOur lease agreements may contain lease and non-lease components, which are combined and accounted for as a single lease component. We also have elected to apply the short-term lease\n\nmeasurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease liabilities are not recognized for leases with terms of 12 months or less.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe use the acquisition method to account for our business combinations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805 - Business Combinations. We allocate the total fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related transaction and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nDuring the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill or the preliminary purchase price, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n\nGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. The Company has one reporting unit and tests goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. We first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative test is performed by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount. We would recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.

Our ability to manage our supply chain may also be adversely affected by other factors including geopolitical conditions such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related economic sanctions against Russia, the U.S. trade war with China and political tensions between China and Taiwan. Global geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties have resulted in prolonged manufacturing and supply chain disruptions, including temporary closures of certain contract manufacturer and supplier facilities particularly within China which, in turn, have caused and may continue to cause shortages of, and extended lead times for, components used to manufacture our products, increases in the prices for such components, a reduction, unpredictability or interruption of supply, prioritization of component shipments to other vendors and decommitments of orders. Insufficient component supply, and increases in the time required to manufacture our products, may lead to prolonged inventory shortages, manufacturing disruptions and increased customer lead times for our products that could result in increased cancellation of orders or loss of future sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors\u2019 products that are readily available.\n\nIn order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, we have issued and expect to continue to issue purchase orders for components and products that are non-cancellable and non-returnable, including purchase commitments for semiconductors as disclosed in Note 5.

Additionally, certain customers have and may continue to engage in cost reduction measures including reductions in capital expenditures and other efficiency efforts which may result in a cancellation of orders or reduce demand for our products. We establish a liability for non-cancellable, non- returnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts, or for products that are considered obsolete. In addition, we establish a liability and reimburse our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders, or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts.

As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\n\nIn addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance\n\nproducts are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.\n\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory\n\nand operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\n\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation.

These risks are further complicated by the company\u2019s extensive international operations, which subject the company to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of the company\u2019s ability to reduce or consolidate its operations and workforce. See also \u201cThe company\u2019s success depends upon its ability to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key executive and employee talent and the strategies they develop and implement\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.\n\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 65%, 66%, and 65%, respectively, of the company\u2019s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the significant extent of the company\u2019s international business and operations, the company is subject to a variety of risks, including the following:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n\u2022 \u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nimport and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports; the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, regulations, treaties, and technical standards, including, without limitation, with respect to tax; potential restrictions on transfers of funds; trade protection measures, import and export tariffs and other restrictions, duties, and value-added taxes; transportation delays and interruptions; uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; foreign laws that potentially discriminate against or disfavor companies headquartered outside the relevant jurisdiction; stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions; volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies; various jurisdictions\u2019 environmental protection laws and regulations, including those related to climate change and sustainability disclosures; non-compliance with local laws; potential social unrest, military conflicts, government shutdowns and disruptions, and other geopolitical risks and uncertainties; and currency fluctuations.\n\n\n\nSee also \u201cThe company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti- corruption laws, anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, as well as tariffs and trade protectionism. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business.\u201d Refer to \u201cForeign Currency Exchange Risk\u201d in Item 7.A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a further discussion of the company\u2019s description of the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on the company\u2019s results and projections.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChanges in the company\u2019s global mix of earnings, tax laws, and regulations could cause fluctuations in the company\u2019s effective tax rate and adversely impact financial results.\n\nThe company\u2019s effective tax rate may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the geographic distribution of earnings, which may subject earnings to different or multiple statutory tax rates. Shifts in the business environment or changes in tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which the company operates may also adversely affect the company\u2019s effective tax rate. For further details on the company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn recent years, numerous domestic and international tax proposals have been issued and enacted which have increased the tax burden on large multinational companies. For example, the OECD has advanced new tax proposals affecting international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax of 15%, which many countries are either considering implementing or have already implemented. Any new tax legislation could impact the company\u2019s tax obligations in the countries where it operates, leading to increased taxation of its international earnings.\n\nMoreover, changes to U.S. or foreign tax laws could have broader implications, including indirect effects on the economy, currency markets, inflation, or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict and may negatively impact the company. Such tax developments could further increase uncertainty and have a material adverse impact on the company\u2019s cash flows, effective tax rate, and financial results.\n\nThe company is regularly audited by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Although the company provisions for income taxes and tax estimates, the final resolution of these audits may differ, in some cases materially, from the estimates reflected in the company's financial results. Additionally, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue by various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more challenging than in the past.\n\nAcquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures may cause the company to experience operating difficulties and other consequences that may negatively impact the company\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results, and the company may not be able to successfully consummate"

            " conditions could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nAdverse economic conditions, continuing uncertain economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications. Weak domestic or global economic conditions and continuing economic uncertainty, fear or anticipation of such conditions, a recession, international trade disputes, global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending or a deterioration of the financial performance, condition or prospects of our customers even if economic conditions improve, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, reduced demand or lower prices for our products and services, higher default rates among our channel partners, reduced unit sales and lower or no growth. While our customers may be adversely affected by negative macroeconomic conditions, the impact may be particularly significant in our enterprise market where we are seeking to increase our penetration into this market. In addition, the global macroeconomic environment has been negatively affected by, among other things, the uncertainty in the global banking and financial services markets, epidemics, instability in global economic markets, the upcoming U.S. presidential election, increased U.S. trade tariffs and trade disputes between the U.S., China and other countries, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, instability in the global credit markets, the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, instability in the geopolitical environment, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, the Houthi attacks on marine vessels in the Red Sea, political tensions between Taiwan and China, political demonstrations, and foreign governmental debt concerns which have caused, and are likely to continue to cause, uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets. A government shutdown or a default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations, or related credit-rating downgrades could also have adverse effects on the broader global economy and contribute to, or worsen, an economic recession. We believe that any extended or renewed economic disruptions or deterioration in the global economy could have an adverse impact to our liquidity or to our current and projected business operations, financial condition or results of operations. For example, if banks or other financial institutions with whom we have banking relationships or whose corporate bonds are held in our marketable securities investment portfolio, enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose some of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the FDIC. In addition, in such circumstances we might not be able to timely pay key vendors and others. We regularly maintain cash balances that are not insured or are in excess of the FDIC\u2019s insurance limit. Any delay in our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and investments (or the loss of such funds) or to timely pay key vendors and others could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cause us to need to seek additional capital sooner than planned.\n\nIn addition, business disruptions and supply chain and manufacturing disruptions may result in customers delaying or canceling or reprioritizing capital expenditures on information technology and network infrastructure, which may affect the overall demand for our products. Customers may also be placing orders based on longer planning horizons to ensure supply. We also believe that our customers continue to assess the impact of these macroeconomic factors on their businesses and future investment plans, resulting in business uncertainty and a more constrained approach to forecasts and orders. Continuing or worsening economic instability or the deterioration of the financial performance, condition or prospects of our customers could result in a cancellation of, or defaults in the payments for, such orders or otherwise adversely affect spending for IT, network infrastructure, systems and tools, and limit our ability to forecast future demand for our products, which could reduce expected revenue or result in a write-down of excess or obsolete inventory. A downturn or a recession may also significantly affect financing markets, the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of any financing arrangements, including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our customers. Circumstances may arise in which we need, or desire, to raise additional capital, and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\nBecause some of the key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply, we have entered into significant purchase commitments and are susceptible to supply shortages, extended lead times or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers and may result in the loss of sales and customers.\n\nOur products rely on components, including merchant silicon chips, integrated circuit components, printed circuit boards, connectors, custom- tooled sheet metal and power supplies that we purchase, or our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers, including certain sole"

Forward-looking statements are those statements which are not statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements can be identified by forward-looking words such as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which could cause actual results or facts to differ materially from such statements for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; disruptions or inefficiencies in the supply chain, including any potential adverse effects of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic; political instability; impacts of military conflict, including the conflict in Ukraine; industry conditions; changes in product supply, pricing and customer demand; competition; other vagaries in the global components and the global enterprise computing solutions (\u201cECS\u201d) markets; deteriorating economic conditions, including economic recession, inflation, tax rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the availability of capital; the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; changes in relationships with key suppliers; increased profit margin pressure; changes in legal and regulatory matters; non-compliance with certain regulations, such as export, antitrust, and anti-corruption laws; foreign tax and other loss contingencies; and the company's ability to generate cash flow. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause the company's future results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, see the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in other filings the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholders and other readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any of the forward-looking statements.\n\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Information\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the company also discloses certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\n\nNon-GAAP sales and non-GAAP gross profit (referred to as \"sales on a constant currency basis\" and \"gross profit on a constant currency basis\") excludes the impact of changes in foreign currencies by re-translating prior period results at current period foreign exchange rates.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses excludes restructuring, integration, and other charges, identifiable intangible asset amortization and the impact of changes in foreign currencies.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income excludes identifiable intangible asset amortization, and restructuring, integration, and other charges. \u2022 Non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders exclude identifiable intangible asset amortization, restructuring, integration, and other charges, pension settlement loss, and net gains and losses on investments.\n\nManagement believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand the company\u2019s operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management, especially when comparing results with previous periods. Management typically monitors the business as adjusted for these items, in addition to GAAP results, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting purposes, for short-term and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate the company's financial performance. However, analysis of results on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable reported GAAP financial measures are included within this MD&A.\n\nOverview\n\nThe company is a global provider of products, services, and solutions to industrial"

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 14, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nOverview\n\nArista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, cognitive cloud networking for next-generation data center and campus workspace environments. At the core of Arista's platform is our EOS software, combined with a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing products using merchant silicon, delivering a cloud networking solution with high performance scale and availability, and enabling network automation, visibility, and security. This flexible EOS-based platform provides customers with improved price/performance and accelerated time to market.\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms, which incorporate our EOS software, and related network applications. We also generate revenue from post-contract support (\"PCS\"), which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products, and renewals of PCS. We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners. As of December 31, 2022, we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 9,000 end customers worldwide. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies, telecommunication service providers and other cloud service providers.\n\nHistorically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to the time it takes these end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our newer products, the overall complexity of these large orders and changes in demand patterns specific to these customers, including reductions in capital expenditures by these customers and the impact of cost reduction and other efficiency efforts by these customers. For example, sales to our end customers Microsoft and Meta Platforms in fiscal 2022 represented 16% and 26% of our total revenue, respectively, whereas sales to our end customer Microsoft in fiscal 2020 and 2021 amounted to 22% and 15% of our total revenue, respectively, with our end customer Meta Platforms representing less than 10% of our total revenue in both fiscal 2020 and 2021. This variability in customer concentration has been linked to the timing of new product deployments and spending cycles with these customers, and we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, some of our large customers have announced various cost reduction measures, including optimization and increased efficiency in their capital expenditures. In some instances, such measures have had, or may have, an impact on certain current or future projects and have reduced our visibility to customer demand, which may result in reductions in future demand and negatively impact our revenue. Furthermore, we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers, which reduces gross margins for the period in which such sales occur.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures. As organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud, spending on cloud and next-generation data centers has increased rapidly, while traditional legacy IT spending has grown more slowly. Our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market, and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices, as well as the need",
            " for constant connectivity and access to data and applications.\n\nThe markets for cloud networking solutions are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing end-customer needs, evolving industry standards, frequent introductions of new products and services, and industry consolidation. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment. We must also continue to develop market-leading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers, and increase sales in the enterprise data center switching and campus workspace markets. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support. In addition, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our ability to rapidly develop new features and applications.\n\nOur development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic with respect to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to expand our software applications to address the ever-increasing demands of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility, analytics and network detection and response, and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We work closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third-party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.\n\nMacroeconomic Update\n\nGlobal economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation, monetary policy shifts, the recent banking crisis, recession risks, and potential supply chain and other disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, and the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nWe have worked closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners to ramp production following a period of delayed component sourcing and workforce disruptions. We have worked diligently to drive improvements in these areas, including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments, and have begun to see some reduction in customer lead times on certain products. Over time, the recovery of capacity should allow us to ship products against previously committed deployment plans and accelerate some deployments where needed, while trying to limit building customer inventory. On this basis, we expect some shipments against these deployment plans to extend into 2024. As customer lead times reduce more broadly, we have seen and expect to continue to see a commensurate reduction in visibility to customer demand and a gradual return to somewhat shorter demand-planning horizons which has resulted in lower demand levels. Given the shipment and order patterns described above, near term revenue trends may not be reflective of current demand levels, but will benefit from deployment plans that had been previously committed. While inventory and working capital levels may continue to increase and remain elevated in the near term, we expect that purchase commitments will continue to decline as supplier lead times shorten. Although these elevated inventory positions and purchase commitments are largely related to relatively early life cycle products, the larger magnitude of these balances, combined with a reduction in customer demand-planning horizons, has resulted in increased risk that we may not be able to sell all of this inventory, which in turn has resulted, and may in the future result, in the need for us to incur excess and obsolete inventory-related charges..\n\nIn addition, inflation pressure in our supply chain, scarcity of some materials needed to build our products and disruptions to our manufacturing process have increased our cost of revenue and have impacted, and may continue to negatively impact our gross margin. Our operating cash-flows have also been and may continue to be negatively impacted by significant component inventories on hand or at our contract manufacturers. While we have seen improvements in our supply chain and manufacturing operations, any remaining or new supply chain and manufacturing related constraints could negatively impact our business in future periods. In addition, although our business has experienced limited disruption as a result of the recent Russia- Ukraine conflict, continued escalation of this conflict as well as the Israeli-Hamas conflict may negatively impact the global economy and our future operating results and financial condition.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nManagement continues to actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic factors on the Company's financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce.

As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\n\nIn addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance\n\nproducts are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.\n\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory\n\nand operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\n\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse\n\n38\n\nTable of Contents\n\neffect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\n\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\n\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take",
            " to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such\n\nas natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\n\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our\n\nBusiness\n\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies\u2019 policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\n\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.\n\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\n\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\n\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important\n\nto our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n39\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\n\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic\n\nalliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores.

Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\n\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse\n\n38\n\nTable of Contents\n\neffect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\n\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\n\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services.

Expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments. Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe have invested and may continue to invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n34\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and could continue to make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies which could involve licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies. For example, we completed the acquisition of Untangle Holdings and Pluribus Networks in 2022 which required management to focus efforts on integrating these acquisitions with the company. We may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete investments or acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers, investors and securities analysts. Through acquisitions, we continue to expand into new markets and new market segments and we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products, including facing exposure to new market risks, difficulty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors.\n\nIn addition, investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. For example, if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected. We may have difficulty retaining the employees of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful. Any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. Any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. We may not be successful in retaining or expanding the customers and sales activities of any acquired business or in realizing the expected operational and cost efficiencies anticipated with the acquisition. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders.

These changes could arise from new tax regulations, interpretations of existing laws, or international agreements like the global minimum tax initiative.

            " international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.\n\nChanges in our income taxes or our effective tax rate, enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.\n\nOur income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; our ability to generate and use tax attributes; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; transfer pricing adjustments from tax authorities challenging our methods for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements; tax effects of nondeductible compensation, including certain stock-based compensation; tax costs related to inter-company restructuring; changes in accounting principles; imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers; or a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain foreign earnings.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our income tax liability. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect income taxes.\n\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change. Changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations, including taxation of earnings outside of the U.S. may have adverse effects on our operating results and could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain. Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions, including the United States, may be subject to significant change. For example, in 2022, the United States passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which made a number of changes to the Internal Revenue Code, including adding a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks by publicly-traded corporations and a 15% corporate minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of certain large companies. The impact of these provisions on our effective tax rate will also depend on additional guidance to be issued by the Treasury Secretary. We are currently evaluating the impact of these provisions on our effective tax rate. While we do not anticipate any adverse impacts to our effective tax rate, we cannot provide any assurances that these provisions will not adversely impact our effective tax rate. Further, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d) eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five years for U.S. incurred expenditures or fifteen years for non-U.S. incurred expenditures, pursuant to IRC Section 174. While there is the potential for legislation that would repeal or defer the capitalization requirement to later years, we have followed the current legislation to capitalize R&D expenditures in our current financial statements. There is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified, however, we do not anticipate any material change to our effective tax rate, if repealing or modifying the legislation is enacted retroactively to 2022. In addition, several countries, including the United States and Ireland as well as the\n\n49\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) have reached agreement on a global minimum tax initiative (\u201cPillar Two\u201d). The Council of the European Union adopted this initiative for enactment by European Union member states by December 31, 2022, with implementation into the domestic laws of those states by the end of 2023. Many countries are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws to align with the recommendations and guidelines proposed by the OECD, including Pillar Two. Enactment of such tax laws could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business.\n\nFinally, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. Audits by the IRS or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes, including potential fines or penalties. As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. The expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant. The amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management\u2019s attention from our business operations. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate, the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting"

One supplier accounted for approximately 13% of the company's consolidated sales in 2022. No other single supplier accounted for more than 7% of the company's consolidated sales in 2022. The company believes that many of the products it sells are available from other sources at competitive prices. However, certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business segment, rely on a limited number of suppliers with the strategy of providing focused support, extensive product knowledge, and customized service to suppliers, MSPs, and VARs. Most of the company's purchases are pursuant to distributor agreements, which are typically non-exclusive and cancellable by either party at any time or on short notice.\n\nTrade Accounts and Notes Receivable\n\nTrade accounts and notes receivable are reported at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses in the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the receivables\u2019 amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected. Receivables are written off against the allowance when management believes the receivable balance is confirmed to be uncollectible. Refer to Notes 1 and 4.\n\nManagement estimates the allowance for credit losses using relevant available information about expected credit losses and an age-based reserve model. Inputs to the model include information about historical credit losses, customer credit ratings, past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current receivable-specific risk characteristics such as changes in the economic and industry environment, or other relevant factors.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective (pool) basis, when similar risk characteristics exist, based on customer credit ratings, which include both externally acquired as well as internally determined credit ratings. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Write-downs of inventories to market value are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection, stock rotation rights, and obsolescence, as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If assumptions about future demand change and/or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company, additional write-downs of inventories may be required. Due to the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations, estimates are made regarding adjustments to the book cost of inventories. Actual amounts could be different from those estimated.\n\n31\n\nIndex\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nThe carrying value of the company\u2019s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions. Should the company determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets is established in the period such determination is made. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires considerable judgment on the part of management with respect to the benefits that could be realized from future taxable income, as well as other positive and negative factors.\n\nIt is also the company\u2019s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management\u2019s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. To the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established, or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, or when other facts and circumstances change, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially affected.\n\nContingencies and Litigation\n\nFrom time to time, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims related to environmental, regulatory, labor, product, tax, and other matters and assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome for these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. A determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after"

If the AI market does not develop as anticipated or at all, then the potential demand for AI Ethernet switches may not be realized. Moreover, even if the market for AI applications does develop, the successful adoption of AI Ethernet products will be dependent upon their ability to compete against more established InfiniBand products to address AI networking clusters.\n\nIf the networking solutions market including the AI Ethernet market does not develop in the way we anticipate or otherwise experiences a slow-down, if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing networking products or if customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nWe pursue new product and service offerings and expand into adjacent markets, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and internal research and development efforts to expand our product offerings and maintain our revenue growth. If we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner or if we fail to introduce products and services that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. For example, with our most recently introduced 800 GbE and AI focused Ethernet products, our ability to continue to maintain our competitive position with our customers will depend on our ability to deliver these new products in a timely manner, our customers' acceptance of these products and the growth of the markets that these products serve. In addition, the evaluation, testing and qualification of our new products by our customers may be lengthy and may require contractual acceptance clauses, which could delay our revenue recognition and impact our revenue and deferred revenue balances.\n\nAdditionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including campus and WiFi networking, cloud and enterprise routing markets, network security markets and SD-WAN markets. Although we believe these solutions are complementary to our current offerings, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in these markets, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. Expanding our services in existing and new markets and increasing the depth and breadth of our presence imposes significant burdens on our marketing, compliance, and other administrative and managerial resources. Our plan to expand and deepen our market share in our existing markets and possibly expand into additional markets is subject to a variety of risks and challenges. Our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to our ability to develop new products, new product features and services that address the customer requirements for these markets, attract a customer base in markets in which we have less experience, compete with new and existing competitors in these adjacent markets, and gain market acceptance of our new products.\n\nDeveloping our products is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. We expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform and introduce new products and features. We expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. These investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\n\nAdditionally, future market share gains may take longer than planned and cause us to incur significant costs. If we are unable to attract new large customers or to sell additional products and\n\nservices to our existing customers, our revenue growth\n\n21\n\nwill be adversely affected, and our revenue could decrease. Difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe expect our gross margins to vary over time and may be adversely affected by numerous factors.\n\nWe expect our",
            " gross margins to vary over time and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors, including but not limited to pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, the ability of more fully integrated competitors to bundle their networking products with other products, or utilize proprietary silicon in their products, the mix of sales to large customers who generally receive lower pricing, the mix of products sold, manufacturing-related costs, including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, and excess/obsolete inventory charges, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers. In addition, other factors that may impact our gross margins over time include the introduction of new products and new business models including the sale and delivery of more software and subscription solutions, entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, entry in markets with different pricing and cost structures, pricing discounts given to customers, costs associated with defending intellectual property rights infringement, misappropriation or other violation claims and the potential outcomes of such disputes, increased costs arising from epidemics, changes in distribution channels, increased warranty costs, and our ability to execute our operating plans. In addition, inflationary pressures and shortages have increased and may continue to increase costs for certain materials, components, supplies and services. As a result of cost inflation in our supply chain, we have implemented targeted price increases from time to time. However, these price increases could result in a decrease in demand for our products which would decrease revenue. In addition, business were subject to sustained economic stress or recession, many of the risk factors identified in this risk factors section could be heightened. We determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenue and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term. As a result, a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter. Failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\n\nWe face intense competition, especially from larger, well-established companies and industry consolidation may lead to further increased competition, which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe markets in which we compete, including the markets for data center, campus networking and network visibility and security, are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors, industry consolidation and new market entrants. This competition has resulted in increased pricing pressure, which could result in reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and the loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by Cisco, with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors, including Extreme Networks, Dell/EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Nvidia, Juniper Networks and white box networking vendors. Most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions and/or have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines, including cloud networking solutions and network security. For example, Cisco acquired Acacia Communications, Broadcom acquired Brocade Communications and VMware, Dell acquired Force10 Networks, Hewlett Packard Enterprise recently announced the acquisition of Juniper Networks. This industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business. Large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver vertically integrated cloud networking solutions to customers that combine cloud-focused hardware and software solutions as an alternative to our products. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us, and this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, the pricing of our solutions, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nWe also face competition from other companies and new market entrants, including current technology partners, suppliers and customers or other cloud service providers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use and/or to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers. Some of these competitors are developing networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, or \u201cwhite box\u201d hardware, particularly where a customer\u2019s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software. Customers may also increase their adoption of\n\n22\n\nnetworking solutions based upon open-source network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on \u201cwhite box\u201d or proprietary hardware. As new markets emerge like AI, we expect the field to remain intensely competitive. In addition, we have not established broad market awareness or acceptance of our AI Ethernet products that will compete against more established InfiniBand products"
