For instance, the raft work was put on hold from March 31, 2021, due to changes, and the ground floor slab work was delayed due to the HVAC contractor not being nominated by the client. Additionally, changes in block work drawings led to extended timelines for ground floor and 1st floor block work. The terrace floor block work was also on hold by the client, and the GRC installation was delayed because the terrace floor was not finalized by the client. Furthermore, aluminum drawing submission was delayed due to changes by the client in the drawings.",
