These include inventory valuation, revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation, employee benefit and pension plans, manufacturing partner and supplier liabilities, allowances for sales returns, allowances for credit losses, useful life of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, impairment loss related to lease abandonment, accrued warranty, operating and finance lease liabilities, restructuring and other related costs and loss contingencies.",

            ", 2022. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were 52-week years that ended on December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. The next 53-week year will end on December 30, 2028.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d)\n\nand pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). The consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's annual results. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts for the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in the Company which the Company has a\n\ncontrolling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company reclassified certain amounts reported in previous periods to conform to the current presentation.\n\n2. Significant Accounting Policies\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and\n\njudgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates, assumptions and judgements made by management include inventory valuation, revenue recognition, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation, employee benefit and pension plans, manufacturing partner and supplier liabilities, allowances for sales returns, allowances for credit losses, useful life of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, impairment loss related to lease abandonment, accrued warranty, operating and finance lease liabilities, restructuring and other related costs and loss contingencies. The Company bases its assumptions on historical experience and also on assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the\n\nconsideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nThe Company determines revenue recognition by applying the following five-step approach:\n\n\n\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\n\n\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\n\n\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\n\n\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\n\n\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\n\n74\n\nINFINERA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\n\nMany of the Company's product sales are sold in combination with installation and deployment services along with initial hardware and software support. The Company's product sales are also sold at times with spares management, on-site hardware replacement services, network operations management, software subscription services, extended hardware warranty and training. Initial software and hardware support services are generally delivered over a one-year period in connection with the initial purchase. Software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases during the warranty support period and hardware warranty provides replacement or repair of equipment that fails to perform in line with specifications. Software subscription services include software warranty and additionally provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period.\n\nSpares management and on-site hardware replacement services include the replacement of defective units at customer sites in accordance with specified\n\nservice level agreements. Network operations management includes the day-to-day operation of a customer's network. These services are generally delivered on an annual basis. The Company evaluates each promised good and service in a contract to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation or should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n\nServices revenue includes software subscription services, installation and deployment services, spares management, on-site hardware replacement\n\nservices, network operations management, extended hardware warranty and training. Revenue from software subscription services, spares management, on-site hardware replacement services, network operations management and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one year, as services are provided over the course of the entire period. Revenue related to training and installation and deployment services is recognized upon completion of the services.\n\nContracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. In addition, shipping documents and customer acceptances, when applicable, are used to verify delivery and transfer of title. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations upon shipment or delivery of product depending on the contractual terms. Payment terms to customers generally range from net 30 to 120 days from invoice, which are considered to be standard payment terms. The Company assesses its ability to collect from"

        "ground_truth": "If there is no observable SSP, it is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information, including but not limited to, gross margin objectives, pricing practices in customer contracts with multiple goods and services, internal costs, historical profitability data, competitor pricing strategies, as well as other observable inputs.",
        "contexts": [
            " 12 to 24 months. If the customer does not purchase the additional capacity within the time frame as stated in the contract, we have the right to deliver and invoice such Instant Bandwidth licenses to the customer. Future committed licenses are considered to be additional performance obligations when a minimum purchase obligation is present, as evidenced by enforceable rights and obligations. As such, we are required to estimate the variable consideration for future Instant Bandwidth licenses as part of determining the contract transaction price.\n\nContract Termination Rights\n\nThe contract term is determined on the basis of the period over which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations. Certain customer contracts include a\n\ntermination for convenience clause that allows the customer to terminate services without penalty, upon advance notification. For such contracts, the service duration is limited to the non-cancelable portion of the contract.\n\nVariable Consideration\n\nThe consideration associated with customer contracts is generally fixed. Variable consideration includes discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, incentives, penalties, or other similar items. The\n\namount of consideration that can vary is not a substantial portion of total consideration.\n\nVariable consideration estimates are re-assessed at each reporting period until a final outcome is determined. The changes to the original transaction price due to a change in estimated\n\nvariable consideration will be applied on a retrospective basis, with the adjustment recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n66\n\nStand-alone Selling Price\n\nThe transaction price for a contract is allocated among the performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. The SSP is the price at which an entity would sell a promised product or service\n\nseparately to a customer.\n\nWhile certain services we sell have readily observable SSPs, the majority of our products and services are generally not sold on a stand-alone basis and therefore SSPs for such products and\n\nservices are not directly observable. If there is no observable SSP, it is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information, including but not limited to, gross margin objectives, pricing practices in customer contracts with multiple goods and services, internal costs, historical profitability data, competitor pricing strategies, as well as other observable inputs. The determination of SSPs for performance obligation is assessed on a periodic basis and estimates are revised to reflect any significant changes to underlying assumptions, as needed.\n\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligation\n\nOur remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied, as of period end, consisting of deferred\n\nrevenue and non-cancellable backlog. Our backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product shipments and services that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of period end. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the amount or timing of the related revenue to change. Orders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt or may relate to multi-year support service obligations.\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss, or credit carryforwards are utilized. Accordingly, realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions against which these deductions, losses and credits can be utilized within the applicable future periods.\n\nWe must assess the likelihood that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions. To the extent the Company believes that recovery does not meet the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d standard, it must establish a valuation allowance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management judgment is required in determining its provision for income taxes, its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a full or partial valuation allowance, all positive and negative evidence must be considered, including the Company's forecast of taxable income over the applicable carryforward periods, its current financial performance, its market environment, and other factors. Based on the available objective evidence, at December 30, 2023, management believes it is not more likely than not that the domestic net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the domestic net deferred tax assets are subject to a full valuation allowance. To the extent that the Company determines that deferred tax assets are realizable on a more likely than not basis, and an adjustment is needed"

As a result, our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors in that area, such as accidents, system failures and weather conditions, natural disasters (including floods and earthquakes and related fires), acts of war and other unforeseen events and circumstances. Any significant interruption in the operations or availability of the storage and distribution facilities in which our inventory is held could lead to logistical and fulfillment issues or increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nInternational customers may also require that we comply with certain testing or customization of our products to conform to local standards. The product development costs\n\nto test or customize our products could be extensive and a material expense for us.\n\n60\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur international operations are also subject to increasingly complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, anti-corruption laws, such as the\n\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\"), and the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, as amended (the \u201cUK Bribery Act\u201d), antitrust or competition laws, anti-money laundering laws, various trade controls, national security related regulations, and data privacy laws, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no complete assurance that any individual employee, contractor or agent will not violate our policies. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring) could also adversely affect our current or future business.\n\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks and\n\nexpenses associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\nA portion of our sales and expenses stem from countries outside of the United States, and are in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and therefore subject to foreign currency\n\nfluctuation. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods. We have from time to time entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain non-functional currency account balances. Even if we have forward contracts in place, while they may reduce some of the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions, they would not cover all foreign-denominated transactions and therefore may not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\n\nOur effective tax rate can be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\n\n\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n\n\n\nchanges in the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\n\n\nchanging tax laws, regulations, rates and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\n\n\nchanges to the financial accounting rules for income taxes;\n\n\n\nthe tax effects of acquisitions; and\n\n\n\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits.\n\nThe United States recently enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other changes, implements a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks, which would\n\ngenerally apply to repurchases of stock by U.S. corporations, including certain transactions with the Capped Calls (as defined below).

Although we and Nokia expect that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\n\n51\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe opinion rendered to us by Centerview will not reflect changes in circumstances between the date of such opinion and the completion of the Merger.\n\nWe have received an opinion from Centerview Partners, LLC (\u201cCenterview\u201d), our financial advisor, in connection with the signing of the\n\nMerger Agreement but have not obtained, nor will we obtain, an updated opinion regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration as of any date other than that specified in Centerview\u2019s opinion. Centerview\u2019s opinion does not address any other term or aspect of the Merger Agreement or the transaction, including, without limitation, the allocation of the Merger Consideration as among holders of our common stock who receive the Cash Consideration, the Share Consideration or the Mixed Consideration, or the relative fairness of the Cash Consideration, the Share Consideration or the Mixed Consideration, and does not constitute a recommendation to any of our stockholders or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the transaction or any other matter, including, without limitation, whether such stockholder or person should elect to receive the Cash Consideration, the Share Consideration or the Mixed Consideration, or make no election, in the transaction. Changes in our operations and prospects, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control, and on which Centerview\u2019s opinion was based, may significantly alter our value or the prices of the shares of our common stock or the prices of the Nokia ADSs by the time the Merger is completed. Centerview\u2019s opinion does not speak as of any date other than the date of such opinion. Because we do not currently anticipate asking Centerview to update its opinion, the opinion will not address the fairness of the Merger Consideration or the applicable exchange ratio, as applicable, from a financial point of view at the time the Merger is completed.\n\nLawsuits filed against us, and members of our Board, challenging the Merger, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.\n\nLawsuits have been filed in connection with the Merger and further litigation or other legal proceedings may arise in the future, including\n\nactions alleging that our Board breached its fiduciary duties to its stockholders by entering into the Merger Agreement, by failing to obtain a greater value in the transaction for its stockholders or otherwise. We, our management and members of our Board, have been and may be subject, along with others (including Nokia), to various claims and litigation related to the Merger. We will defend against the lawsuits filed, but might not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial position, including through the possible diversion of our resources or distraction of key personnel.\n\nThird parties may terminate or alter existing contracts with us in connection with the Merger.\n\nWe have contracts with customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners which may require us to obtain\n\nconsent or waivers from such counterparties in connection with the Merger, including under change of control provisions. If these consents or waivers cannot be obtained, the Enlarged Company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue and may lose rights that are material to its business and the business of the Enlarged Company. In addition, third parties with whom we currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their relationship with us in anticipation of consummation of the Merger. Any such disruptions could limit the En"

        "question": "What prompts a quantitative test for goodwill impairment?",
        "ground_truth": "A quantitative test for goodwill impairment is prompted if the Company determines, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.",

            " reduced to the estimated fair value. If assets are determined to be recoverable, but the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the carrying value of the assets is depreciated over the newly determined remaining useful lives.\n\nAccrued Warranty\n\nIn the Company's contracts with its customers, the Company warrants that its products will operate substantially in conformity with product specifications. Hardware warranties provide the purchaser with protection in the event that the product does not perform to product specifications. During the warranty period, the purchaser\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy in the event of such defect or failure to perform is limited to the correction of the defect or failure by repair, refurbishment or replacement, at the Company\u2019s sole option and expense. The Company's hardware warranty periods generally range from one to five years from date of acceptance for hardware and the Company's software warranty is 90 days. Upon delivery of the Company's products, the Company provides for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty. The hardware warranty accrual is based on actual historical returns and cost of repair experience and the application of those historical rates to the Company's in-warranty installed base. The provision for warranty claims fluctuates depending upon the installed base of products and the failure rates and costs of repair associated with these products under warranty. Furthermore, the Company's costs of repair vary based on repair volume and its ability to repair, rather than replace, defective units. In the event that actual product failure rates and costs to repair differ from the Company's estimates, revisions to the warranty provision are required. In addition, from time to time, specific hardware warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise with specific products. The Company regularly assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the\n\nrespective assets. In-process research and development represent the fair value of incomplete research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. Initially, these assets are not subject to amortization, but once projects have been completed, these assets are transferred to developed technology, which are subject to amortization, while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to research and development.\n\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nThe Company tests for impairment of goodwill on an annual\n\n81\n\nINFINERA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\n\nbasis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the Company determines that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required or it can directly perform the quantitative analysis. The Company recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized does not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of these assets by determining whether or not the carrying amount will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, the Company records an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company has operating leases primarily for real estate (facilities) and automobiles. The Company has finance leases primarily for computer hardware,\n\nlaboratory and manufacturing equipment and leasehold and building improvements.\n\nThe Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. These leases have varying terms that range from one to 11 years and\n\ncontain leasehold improvement incentives, rent holidays and escalation clauses. In addition, some of these leases have renewal options for up to six years.\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right of use (\"ROU\") assets,\n\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities"

The Contractor sought reimbursement for the additional costs incurred in maintaining these temporary LCs at both incomplete ROBs and RUBs. The Contractor highlighted that NTC track laying had been halted at two locations due to obstructions, including staging works for an ROB at LC124 and a functional gate lodge at LC116. Despite proposing solutions and submitting variation claims, the Contractor had faced delays and no approval for compensation, leading to further idle periods for the NTC machine.\n\n246.

            " For example, the United States has imposed tariffs on a large variety of products originating from China, including some on components that are supplied to us from China. Depending upon the duration and implementation of these and future tariffs, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs could materially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of goods sold, increased pricing for customers and reduced sales. Additionally, the U.S. government has levied controls affecting the ability to send certain products and technology related to semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing and supercomputing to China without an export license and adding additional entities to restricted party lists. It remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the governments of the United States or China with respect to such trade and tariff matters. Any change in import and export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies impacted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations.

From time to time, the E.U. restricts or considers restricting certain substances under these directives. For example, InP has been considered for restriction under RoHS. Any restriction of InP or any other substance integral to our systems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we experience a problem complying with these laws and regulations, it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or it could cause us to incur liabilities or costs related to health, safety or environmental remediation or compliance.

If we experience a problem or fail to comply with such safety standards or laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\n\nRegulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, as well as customer, supplier, investor or other stakeholder demands, may add operational complexity for us.\n\nThere has been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") matters that affect companies globally, including by the SEC. A number of our\n\ncustomers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include environmental or social responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should or must comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring companies to disclose corporate ESG policies, practices and metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both, incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as supplier, customer, investor, employee or other stakeholder expectations, on corporate ESG responsibility practices and disclosure, are subject to change, can be unpredictable, may conflict and may be difficult and expensive for us to implement or comply with. If we are unable to comply with, or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply with such policies or provisions, or meet the requirements of our suppliers, customers, investors, employees or other stakeholders, we may be harmed reputationally or financially and our results of operations may be impacted.\n\n66\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are subject to global laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity that could adversely affect our business or subject us to liability.\n\nData privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity are areas of increasing focus for our customers, governmental regulators and privacy advocates, and many jurisdictions,\n\nincluding the E.U., the United States, China and other regions, are evaluating or have implemented laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, which can affect the market and requirements for networking and communications equipment.

OBJECTIVE OF THE REPORT\n\n15. This report is an interim submission pertaining to the required Extension of Time sought by the Contractor for completion of the Works. This application is submitted to the Engineer/Employer with an objective to demonstrate the Contractor\u2019s entitlement to the respective extension of timelines and the consequential costs incurred due to the same, by performing a Delay Analysis with respect to the various delay events.\n\n16. The Contractor made its assessment, while considering relevant Contractual provisions, planned scheme of the Works, documentary evidence of progress of various works, and by adopting standard practices/methodology of Delay Analysis.\n\n17. In this report, the Contractor performed the Delay Analysis using \u2018Time Impact Analysis\u2019 method, covering the period of analysis from the \u2018Cut-Off Date of the EOT-09\u2019, i.e., 26 March 2022 till 30 September 2024 (the \u2018Cut-Off Date of the EOT-10\u2019). 1.2. STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT\n\n18. This report is sub-divided into various interconnected parts, covering the background of the Project, current status of the Project, the approach and methodology adopted in the Delay Analysis, detailed Delay Events and the major findings from the Analysis.\n\n19. The structure of the Report consists of the following parts:\n\nPart 1- Introduction\n\nThis part describes the Objective of the Report, Structure of the Report, Documents Relied Upon, Reference to Industry Standards and Procedures performed by the Contractor.\n\nPart 2 - Executive Summary\n\nThis part summarizes the subsequent parts of the Report, in a way that the reader will get briefly acquainted with the contents of the Report.\n\nPart 3- Status of Previous EOT Applications\n\n8\n\nDFCC (Western Corridor Phase \u2013 2) Civil, Building and Track Works in Vaitarna- Sachin Section Package: CTP - 12\n\nEXPRESS FREIGHT CONSORTIUM\n\nEOT-10\n\nThis part describes the summary of the EOTs, claimed by the Contractor and determined by the Engineer.\n\nPart 4- Relevant Provisions of the Contract\n\nThis part illustrates the Contractual basis of the Contractor's claim for the Extension of Time for completion of the Works and the consequential costs arising out of or in connection therewith.\n\nPart 5- Delay Events considered in this Submission\n\nThis part provides chronological narratives of the various delay events, occurred during execution of the Project from the \u2018Cut-Off Date of the EOT- 09\u2019, i.e., 26 March 2022 till 30 September 2024 (the \u2018Cut-Off Date of the E",

The Project has been critically affected by some major delays6 including but not limited to delay due to unavailability of access to the Site by the Employer/other\n\n4 Contractor\u2019s Letter No. IRCON/3018/DFCCIL-CTP-12/CM/01/03/919, dated 12 November 2015 5 Engineer\u2019s Letter No. L/OCGC/DFCC/CMT/CTP-1211612/2055, dated 19 December 2016 6 Refer Part 5 of this submission for details\n\n11\n\nDFCC (Western Corridor Phase \u2013 2) Civil, Building and Track Works in Vaitarna- Sachin Section Package: CTP - 12\n\nEXPRESS FREIGHT CONSORTIUM\n\nEOT-10\n\nContractors, encumbrances/hindrances/land issues, additional time on account of Variations instructed by the Engineer/Employer, etc.\n\n30. The Contractor, in accordance with the terms and condition as set under the Contract, had raised various applications for Extension of Time (EOT)7 including its recent EOT Application No. 09 dated 14 November 20228 for the delays accrued till the Cut-off Date of 25 March 2022, which were beyond control of the Contractor entitling upto 12 May 2025 i.e., 2042 days.\n\n31. As on date, the Engineer had assessed the Contractor\u2019s various applications for Extension of Time, the Completion date of the Project was extended up to 03 February 2023 i.e., EOT of 1213 days was determined against 2042 days sought vide EOT Application No. 09, acknowledging the several delay factors faced by the Contractor which were beyond its control along with identification of the concurrent delays. However, without prejudice to its rights under the Contract and the law, the Contractor showed its dissatisfaction against the Engineer\u2019s determinations through Notice of Dispute/Dissatisfaction including its recent letter dated 30 May 20239.\n\n32. The Engineer determined the EOT-9 claim after a massive delay of 154 days in blatant disregard of clause 20.1 of GCC/PC mandating a timeline of 42 days for such determination. Moreover, such determination was done improperly and inadequately without evaluating the EOT-9 claim based on factual status of the project.\n\n33. The Engineer's determination, issued vide letter No. 65649 dated 15th May 2023, extended the milestone as below: MS-1 on 19 August 2022, MS-2 on 9 November 2022, and MS-3 on 03 February 2023. The Engineer\u2019s determination is wholly unilateral and unjustified as the Employer has fulfilled his contractual obligations like handover of Major bridges (MJB 166, 163, 92, 115) constructed by other DFCCIL contractors for track linking, handover of access to site (DFC Ch. 134+978 to 134 + 800, 400 m land at Saphale ROB, 156+160 to 156+200 near Jiten farm) at some stretches etc. after the extended MS-I date, i.e. 19th August 2022 as determined by the Engineer against EOT-9 claim.\n\n34. It is evident that the Engineer has inordinately and unreasonably delayed the determination of the Contractor\u2019s EOT claims. The Engineer was requested by the Contractor to review the wrongful, illogical and inadequate determination of EOT-9 vide letter no. 10607 dated 06 May 2024. However, the Engineer outrightly declined to review the determinations on merits.

These issues can also lead to increased engineering and material costs if components need to be replaced or products transitioned to end-of-life status.

            " making additional or long-term purchase commitments with our suppliers or by holding higher levels of inventory, could negatively impact our cash flow and financial results if we do not accurately forecast customer demand or if our customers change their purchasing patterns in response to the evolving supply chain environment. Further, the lead times required for these mitigation efforts may not allow us to take advantage of market price decreases or meet increased customer demand in a timely manner.\n\nWe currently purchase several key components for our products from sole or limited sources. In particular, we rely on our own production of certain components of our products, such as PICs,\n\nand on third parties, including sole source and limited source suppliers, for certain of the components of our products, including ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays, processors, and other semiconductor and optical components. We have increased our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture components for certain products, some of which require custom development. We purchase most of these components on a purchase order basis and generally only have long-term contracts with these sole source or limited source suppliers. If any of our sole source or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints, materials shortages, lower than expected yields, deployment delays, geopolitical-related disruptions, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule, which could result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, these same suppliers may decide to no longer manufacture or support specific components necessary for some of our legacy products, which could lead to our inability to fulfill demand without increased engineering and material costs necessary to replace such components or cause us to transition such products to end-of-life status sooner than planned. Further, our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all, go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us. If any of these developments were to occur, we may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components within a suitable time frame to be able to operate our business, or at all.\n\n23\n\nThe loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require us to redesign products that use such components, which could result in lost revenue,\n\nadditional product and engineering costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Due to cross dependencies, any supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the demand for our products in the short term. In addition, if our contract manufacturers do not receive critical components in a timely manner to build our products, then we would not be able to ship certain products in a timely manner and would, therefore, be unable to meet our prospective customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. In the past, we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing. In addition, some of our suppliers have gone out of business, merged with other suppliers, or limited their supply of components to us, which may cause us to experience longer than normal lead times, supply delays and increased prices. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, strong demand in the industry for such components, or other disruptions in our supply chain. For example, during 2022, several of our materials suppliers with manufacturing facilities near Shanghai, China were affected by COVID-19-related quarantines, which have since been lifted. At certain times, these quarantines led to delayed shipments to certain of our contract manufacturers, which subsequently constrained the ability of these contract manufacturers to supply certain components to us on a timely basis. Disruptions to global macroeconomic conditions may also make it more difficult for us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and manufacturing capacity. These supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future, which could limit our ability to produce our products and cause us to fail to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements. Any failure to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements could harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which would harm our business and operating results.\n\nWe are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue from period to period and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results.\n\nA relatively small number of customers accounts for a large percentage of our revenue from period to period. For example, for the year ended December 30, 2023, our top ten end-customers\n\naccounted for approximately 52% of our total revenue and one end-customer accounted for 10% of our total revenue. For 2022, our top ten end-customers accounted for approximately 48% of our total revenue and one end-customer accounted for 11% of our total revenue.",
            " customers.\n\nSupply chain and logistics issues, including delays, shortages, longer than normal lead times, unfavorable contractual terms, components that have been discontinued and increased costs, and our dependency on sole source, limited source or high-cost suppliers, could harm our business and operating results.\n\nWe are reliant on our global supply chain for the production of components for our products. The global supply chain has experienced disruptions that began in 2020 as a\n\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to delays, shortages, longer than normal lead times, unfavorable contractual terms relating to refundability and cancellation, components that have been discontinued and increased costs. These supply disruptions have negatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations. For example, shortages of and longer lead times for certain key components have adversely affected our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner. Additionally, price increases within our supply chain have continued to negatively affect our gross margin. The global supply chain for components for our products, especially for semiconductor components, continues to experience shortages and increased costs, despite lead times beginning to lessen in duration. These shortages and increased costs are expected to continue throughout 2023. We cannot predict with certainty the scope, magnitude or duration of the impact that these supply chain disruptions will have on our business and results of operations. Any efforts that we make to mitigate supply chain issues, such as by making additional or long-term purchase commitments with our suppliers or by holding higher levels of inventory, could negatively impact our cash flow and financial results if we do not accurately forecast customer demand or if our customers change their purchasing patterns in response to the evolving supply chain environment.

We may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, strong demand in the industry for such components, or other disruptions in our supply chain. For example, during 2022, several of our materials suppliers with manufacturing facilities near Shanghai, China were affected by COVID-19-related quarantines, which have since been lifted.

Our products are built with and incorporate increasingly sophisticated technology and any delays by our contract manufacturers or their inability to meet our product specifications or quality standards may cause us to be unable to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, which could decrease customer satisfaction and harm our product sales. In addition, if our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products or components of our products in required volumes or our relationship with any of our contract manufacturers is discontinued for any reason, we would be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers, which could cause us to be unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers and result in the breach of our customer agreements. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming. If we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer, we could lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.\n\nIncreased consolidation among our customers and suppliers in the communications networking industry has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\nWe have seen increased consolidation in the communications networking industry over the past few years, which has adversely affected our business and results of\n\noperations. Customer consolidation in the past has led to changes in buying patterns, slowdowns in spending, redeployment of existing equipment and re-architecture of parts of existing networks or future networks, as the combined companies evaluate the needs of the combined business. Moreover, the significant purchasing power of these large companies can increase pricing and competitive pressures for us, including the potential for decreases in our average selling prices. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide it with products or relies on another provider of similar products, we may lose that customer\u2019s business. Such consolidation may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenue and may exacerbate the risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. Any of the foregoing results will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, our suppliers in the communications networking industry have continued to consolidate in recent years. For example, II-VI acquired Coherent in 2022. Supplier\n\nconsolidation may lead to increased prices of components for our products, deployment delays or a disruption in output. In addition, such consolidation may exacerbate the risks relating to our dependence on a small number of suppliers for certain components and materials that are required to manufacture our products.\n\nWe rely on various third-party service partners to help complement our global operations, and failure to adequately manage these relationships could adversely impact our financial results and relationships with customers.\n\nWe rely on a number of third-party service partners, both domestic and international, to complement our global operations. We rely upon these partners for certain installation, maintenance, logistics and support functions. Services provided by these partners typically relate to the design, construction and operation of customer networks. Over time, the scope of work performed by our service partners is likely to increasingly include areas where we have less experience providing or managing such services. We must successfully identify, assess, train and certify qualified service partners in order to ensure the proper installation, deployment and maintenance of our products. The vetting and certification of these partners, particularly outside the U.S., can be costly and time-consuming, and certain partners may not have the same operational history, financial resources and scale as we have. Additionally, certain service partners may provide similar services for other companies, including our competitors. We may not be able to manage our relationships with our service partners effectively, and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver services in the manner or time required, that we will be able to maintain the continuity of their services, or that they will adhere to our approach to ethical business practices. We may also be exposed to a number of risks or challenges relating to the performance of our service partners, including:\n\n\n\ndelays in recognizing revenue;\n\n61\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022\n\nliability for injuries to persons, damage to property or other claims relating to the actions or omissions of our service partners;\n\n\u2022\n\nour services revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected; and\n\n\n\nour relationships with customers could suffer.\n\nIf we do not effectively manage our relationships with third-party service partners, or if they fail to perform the services we request in the manner or time required, our\n\nfinancial results and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.\n\nWe must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.\n\nThe optical transport networking equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards.

Initial software and hardware support services are generally delivered over a one-year period in connection with the initial purchase. Software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases during the warranty support period and hardware warranty provides replacement or repair of equipment that fails to perform in line with specifications. Software subscription services include software warranty and additionally provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period.\n\nSpares management and on-site hardware replacement services include the replacement of defective units at customer sites in accordance with specified\n\nservice level agreements. Network operations management includes the day-to-day operation of a customer's network. These services are generally delivered on an annual basis. We evaluate each promised good and service in a contract to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation or should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n\nServices revenue includes software subscription services, installation and deployment services, spares management, on-site hardware replacement\n\nservices, network operations management, extended hardware warranty and training. Revenue from software subscription services, spares management, on-site hardware replacement services, network operations management and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period, which is generally one year, as services are provided over the course of the entire period. Revenue related to training and installation and deployment services is recognized upon completion of the services.\n\nContracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. In addition, shipping documents and customer acceptances, when applicable, are used to verify delivery and transfer of title. We typically satisfy our performance obligations upon shipment or delivery of product depending on the contractual terms. Payment terms to customers generally range from net 30 to 120 days from invoice, which are considered to be standard payment terms. We assess our ability to collect from our customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer.\n\nCustomer product returns are generally approved on a case by case basis. Specific reserve provisions are made based upon a specific review of all the\n\napproved product returns where the customer has yet to return the products to generate the related sales return credit at the end of a period. Estimated sales returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue.\n\nFor sales to resellers, the same revenue recognition criteria apply. It is our practice to identify an end-user prior to shipment to a reseller. We do not offer\n\nrights of return or price protection to our resellers.\n\nWe report revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current\n\nliabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\n\nCustomer Purchase Commitments\n\nWe sell software licenses that provide customers the ability to purchase incremental bandwidth capacity on an already-deployed piece of hardware. Instant\n\nBandwidth-enabled systems generally include a specific initial capacity and incremental capacity can be added by the purchase of Instant Bandwidth licenses. Instant Bandwidth licenses are considered distinct performance obligations because customers can provision additional transmission capacity on demand without the deployment of any incremental equipment.\n\n60\n\nSome contracts commit the customer to purchase incremental Instant Bandwidth licenses within a specified time frame from the initial shipment of the\n\nInstant Bandwidth-enabled hardware. The time frame varies by customer and generally ranges between 12 to 24 months. If the customer does not purchase the additional capacity within the time frame as stated in the contract, we have the right to deliver and invoice such Instant Bandwidth licenses to the customer. Future committed licenses are considered to be additional performance obligations when a minimum purchase obligation is present, as evidenced by enforceable rights and obligations. As such, we are required to estimate the variable consideration for future Instant Bandwidth licenses as part of determining the contract transaction price.\n\nContract Termination Rights\n\nThe contract term is determined on the basis of the period over which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations. Certain\n\ncustomer contracts include a termination for convenience clause that allows the customer to terminate services without penalty, upon advance notification. For such contracts, the service duration is limited to the non-cancelable portion of the contract.\n\nVariable Consideration\n\nThe consideration associated with customer contracts is generally fixed. Variable consideration includes discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, incentives,\n\npenalties, or other similar items. The amount of consideration that can vary is not a substantial portion of total consideration.\n\nVariable consideration estimates are re-assessed at each reporting period until a final outcome is determined. The changes to the original transaction price due to a change in estimated variable consideration will be applied on a retrospective basis, with the adjustment recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n\nStand-alone Selling Price\n\nStand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a good or service on a stand-alone (or separate) basis at contract inception.

As part of our remediation plan, we plan to review and enhance our personnel with the appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge, experience, and training in the application of GAAP commensurate with the complexity of our business and our financial accounting and reporting requirements, particularly in areas related to our revenue and inventory cycles. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our securities. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\n\nWe are subject to various governmental export control, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.\n\nIn some cases, our products are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations that may limit where and to whom we are permitted to sell our products,\n\nincluding the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to trade and economic sanctions, including those administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (collectively, \u201cTrade Controls\u201d). As such, a license may be required to export or re- export our products, or provide related services, to certain countries and end-users, and for certain end-uses. Further, our products incorporating encryption functionality may be subject to special controls applying to encryption items or certain reporting requirements.\n\nWe have procedures in place designed to ensure our compliance with Trade Controls, with respect to which failure to comply could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration of responsible individuals for willful violations, possible loss of our export or import privileges, or reputational harm. Further, the process for obtaining necessary licenses may be time-consuming or unsuccessful, potentially causing delays in sales or losses of sales opportunities. Trade Controls are complex and dynamic regimes, and monitoring and ensuring compliance can be challenging, particularly given that our products are widely distributed throughout the world. Although we have no knowledge that our activities have resulted in material violations of Trade Controls, any failure by us or our partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations would have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.\n\n74\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and certain product\n\nfeatures or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in U.S. and foreign import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the import and export of our products to certain countries altogether. For example, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on a large variety of products originating from China, including some on"

Further, the lead times required for these mitigation efforts may not allow us to take advantage of market price decreases or meet increased customer demand in a timely manner.\n\nWe currently purchase several key components for our products from sole or limited sources. In particular, we rely on our own production of certain components of our products, such as PICs,\n\nand on third parties, including sole source and limited source suppliers, for certain of the components of our products, including ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays, processors, and other semiconductor and optical components. We have increased our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture components for certain products, some of which require custom development. We purchase most of these components on a purchase order basis and generally only have long-term contracts with these sole source or limited source suppliers. If any of our sole source or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints, materials shortages, lower than expected yields, deployment delays, geopolitical-related disruptions, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule, which could result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, these same suppliers may decide to no longer manufacture or support specific components necessary for some of our legacy products, which could lead to our inability to fulfill demand without increased engineering and material costs necessary to replace such components or cause us to transition such products to end-of-life status sooner than planned. Further, our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all, go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us. If any of these developments were to occur, we may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components within a suitable time frame to be able to operate our business, or at all.\n\n23\n\nThe loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require us to redesign products that use such components, which could result in lost revenue,\n\nadditional product and engineering costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Due to cross dependencies, any supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the demand for our products in the short term. In addition, if our contract manufacturers do not receive critical components in a timely manner to build our products, then we would not be able to ship certain products in a timely manner and would, therefore, be unable to meet our prospective customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. In the past, we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing. In addition, some of our suppliers have gone out of business, merged with other suppliers, or limited their supply of components to us, which may cause us to experience longer than normal lead times, supply delays and increased prices. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, strong demand in the industry for such components, or other disruptions in our supply chain. For example, during 2022, several of our materials suppliers with manufacturing facilities near Shanghai, China were affected by COVID-19-related quarantines, which have since been lifted. At certain times, these quarantines led to delayed shipments to certain of our contract manufacturers, which subsequently constrained the ability of these contract manufacturers to supply certain components to us on a timely basis. Disruptions to global macroeconomic conditions may also make it more difficult for us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and manufacturing capacity. These supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future, which could limit our ability to produce our products and cause us to fail to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements. Any failure to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements could harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which would harm our business and operating results.\n\nWe are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue from period to period and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results.\n\nA relatively small number of customers accounts for a large percentage of our revenue from period to period. For example, for the year ended December 30, 2023, our top ten end-customers\n\naccounted for approximately 52% of our total revenue and one end-customer accounted for 10% of our total revenue. For 2022, our top ten end-customers accounted for approximately 48% of our total revenue and one end-customer accounted for 11% of our total revenue.",
            " customers.\n\nSupply chain and logistics issues, including delays, shortages, longer than normal lead times, unfavorable contractual terms, components that have been discontinued and increased costs, and our dependency on sole source, limited source or high-cost suppliers, could harm our business and operating results.\n\nWe are reliant on our global supply chain for the production of components for our products. The global supply chain has experienced disruptions that began in 2020 as a\n\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to delays, shortages, longer than normal lead times, unfavorable contractual terms relating to refundability and cancellation, components that have been discontinued and increased costs. These supply disruptions have negatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations. For example, shortages of and longer lead times for certain key components have adversely affected our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner. Additionally, price increases within our supply chain have continued to negatively affect our gross margin. The global supply chain for components for our products, especially for semiconductor components, continues to experience shortages and increased costs, despite lead times beginning to lessen in duration. These shortages and increased costs are expected to continue throughout 2023. We cannot predict with certainty the scope, magnitude or duration of the impact that these supply chain disruptions will have on our business and results of operations. Any efforts that we make to mitigate supply chain issues, such as by making additional or long-term purchase commitments with our suppliers or by holding higher levels of inventory, could negatively impact our cash flow and financial results if we do not accurately forecast customer demand or if our customers change their purchasing patterns in response to the evolving supply chain environment.

The Company estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies.\n\nFacilities-related Charges\n\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its facilities-related charges associated with its restructuring plans, based on estimated future discounted cash\n\nflows and unobservable inputs, which includes the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts that the Company can reasonably obtain over the remaining lease term and the discount rate.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses\n\nresulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and reviewed the allowance quarterly. The Company determines expected credit losses by performing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition, establishing both a general reserve and specific reserve for customers in adverse financial condition and adjusting for its expectations of changes in conditions that may impact the collectability of outstanding receivables. The Company considers a customer's receivable balance past due when the amount is due beyond the credit terms extended, The Company considers factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and geographic or country-specific risks. Amounts are written off when receivables are determined to be uncollectible.\n\nAllowances for Sales Returns\n\nCustomer product returns are approved on a case by case basis. Specific reserve provisions are made based upon a specific review of all the approved\n\nproduct returns where the customer has yet to return the products to generate the related sales return credit at the end of a period. Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to revenue. At December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, revenue was reduced for estimated sales returns by $3.6 million, $0.8 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.\n\nConcentration of Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, foreign\n\nexchange contracts and accounts receivable.\n\nThe risk with respect to foreign exchange contracts is mitigated by entering into these contracts with a large high-quality financial institution and the\n\nCompany monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparty consistently.\n\nThe risk with respect to accounts receivable is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations that the Company performs on its customers. As the Company continues to expand its sales internationally, it may experience increased levels of customer credit risk associated with those regions. Collateral is generally not required for accounts receivable but may be used in the future to mitigate credit risk associated with customers located in certain geographical regions.\n\n79\n\nINFINERA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(Continued)\n\nOne customer accounted for over 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance, net on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022.\n\nNo customer accounted for over 10% of the Company's accounts receivable balance, net on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 25, 2021.\n\nOne customer accounted for approximately 11% of the Company's revenue in 2022 and 2020. No customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's\n\nrevenue in 2021.\n\nThe Company depends on sole source or limited source suppliers for several key components and raw materials. The Company generally purchases\n\nthese sole source or limited source components and raw materials through standard purchase orders and does not have long-term contracts with many of these limited-source suppliers. While the Company seeks to maintain sufficient reserve stock of such components and raw materials, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be adversely affected if any of its sole source or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints, lower than expected yields, deployment delays, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output.\n\nDerivative Instruments\n\nThe Company"
