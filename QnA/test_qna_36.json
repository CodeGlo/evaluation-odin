Each capitalized term used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in, or by reference in, Exhibit A hereto, and the interpretive provisions set out in Exhibit A hereto shall be applied in the interpretation of this Agreement.\n\nAccordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n\nAGREEMENT\n\n1. Sale and Purchase.\n\n(a) Sales of Receivables. From time to time during the term of this Agreement, one or more Sellers may submit to the Administrative Agent a request (a \u201cPurchase Request\u201d) via the Technology Platform (which Purchase Request shall be forwarded by the Platform Provider to the Administrative Agent) that the Buyers purchase from such Seller or Sellers the Proposed Receivables described in such Purchase Request on the proposed Purchase Date indicated therein; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if (i) the Technology Platform is not operational or is otherwise offline or (ii) the Administrative Agent has, in its discretion, instructed the Sellers that the Technology Platform is no longer available for use, then such Seller or Sellers may deliver a Purchase Request to the Administrative Agent in a form agreed between the Administrative Agent and the Sellers, and this Agreement shall be construed and interpreted accordingly, mutatis mutandis.\n\n(b) If received by no later than 1:00 p.m. New York City time (or such later time as agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the Buyers in writing in their sole and absolute discretion) on a Business Day from such Seller, by no later than 5:00 p.m. New York City time (or such later time as agreed to by the Buyers in writing in their sole and absolute discretion) on such date, the Administrative Agent shall transmit such Purchase Request to each Buyer having a Pro Rata Share in any Proposed Receivables described in such Purchase Request via electronic mail or another communication method designated by the Administrative Agent, together with an estimate of the Purchase Price for such Proposed Receivables (as calculated by the Platform Administrator (or by the Platform Provider on its behalf) in accordance with its normal policies and procedures), and the Pro Rata Share of each such Buyer (as calculated by the Platform Administrator (or by the Platform Provider on its behalf) in accordance with its normal policies and procedures).

            " of the Quality Control System, selection of the borrow pits, fixing of the Sub-\n\nContractors etc., were to be carried out by the claimant in the initial 9 months\n\nwhich did not require actual possession of site. However the fact remains that the\n\npossession of substantial portion of the site was made available to the Claimant\n\nfrom the very inception.\n\nIt is submitted that the Claimant had mobilised the first Sub-Contractor on only in\n\nthe month of December 2013, and the Alignment in the present project was\n\nfinalized only in the Month of June 2016 this clearly shows delay on the part of\n\nthe Claimant as can be evinced form the contemporaneous MPRs.\n\n174\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent had duly complied with the contract conditions and had provided\n\nsufficient land to the Claimant for execution of the work. It was the Claimant who\n\ndid not have adequate resources in the form of men and machinery to take\n\npossession of the land. The Claimant did not have adequate resources at site to\n\ncarry out the work in the unencumbered portion of land. It did not have sufficient\n\nmanpower to undertake interface activities with the other agencies for removal of\n\nchartered and unchartered utilities from the site. All of such breaches, lapses and\n\nshortcomings had been duly highlighted by the Respondent in the slow progress\n\nnotices, monthly progress reports and during monthly progress review meetings.\n\nAll of this may be taken into consideration while deciding the issues. It was also\n\nhighlighted that the parties during the joint surveys of the site on various occasions\n\nhad admitted of handing over of sufficient land. Anything contrary to the same is\n\ndisputed and denied by the Respondent. It is submitted that the Respondent its\n\nletters dated 02.04.2013 and 02.05.2013 had specifically called upon the Claimant\n\nto depute its officials to take 80% of the land under the contract. Despite such\n\nspecific letter, there was no response from the Claimant. Further, through the letter\n\ndated 11.06.2013, 90% of the land was made available to the Claimant and the\n\nClaimant was called upon to depute its officials to take possession of the land.\n\nThereafter, it was duly recorded through Respondent\u2019s letter dated 27.05.2014,\n\nthat 100% land had been handed over to the Claimant.\n\n37. The contents of Paras 34 to 37 are wrong and denied. It is denied that the\n\nRespondent had failed to provide encumbrance free land to the Claimant. The\n\nvarious contract conditions cited in the para 34 to 37 do not support the case of\n\nthe Claimant.\n\nThe contents of paragraph 34 are entirely denied as being false and frivolous, save\n\nand except matters on record. The present Contract is Design Build Contract\n\n[yellow book] and mandates that the Claimant had to shift the utilities which was\n\nincluded in the Scope of the work and the Contract Price. The Contract also\n\n175\n\nenvisaged the shifting of the unchartered utilities within the Scope of the\n\nContractor for which the Claimant had to build in the overall time of completion.\n\nThere were 40 Chartered utilities to be shifted by the Claimant available at Pg.\n\n2527 - 2531 of Volume VI of the SOC and which in fact were to be shifted by the\n\nClaimant within the Contract Price without any variation. However there were\n\nenormous delays by the Claimant in carrying out the works of shifting of the said\n\nutilities. There were 17 nos. unchartered utilities for which the Claimant has been\n\npaid.\n\nThe fact that the Claimant shifted the chartered and unchartered utilities up until\n\nJanuary 2019 would prove that there was severe delays on part of the claimant and\n\nno delay can be attributed to the respondent.\n\nThe contents of paragraph 35 to 37 are the contractual clauses of the Contract.\n\nIt is a matter of record that sufficient land was made available to the Claimant. The\n\nletters referred in the Para above clearly show that land was made available to the\n\nClaimant from the very inception. Subsequently, at some locations there were\n\nagitation by the land owners which the Claimant ought to have resolved by taking\n\nsupport from the local police and administration. It had failed to fulfil such\n\nobligations casted upon the Claimant. At other locations, the Claimant was unable\n\nto remove/relocate the chartered as well as unchartered utilities which again was\n\nwithin the role and responsibility of the Claimant. At few locations, hindrances in\n\n"

            "\n101 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nA contractor delay concurrent with many owner delays would negate the contractor\u201fs entitlement to delay compensation. Similarly, one owner delay concurrent with many contractor delays would negate the owner\u201fs entitlement to delay compensation, including liquidated/stipulated damages. While in such extreme cases the rule seems draconian, it is a symmetrical rule that applies to both the owner and the contractor and hence ultimately equitable.\n\n4.2. Identification and Quantification of Concurrent Delay\n\nA. Relevance and Application\n\nProjects are frequently delayed by multiple impacts and by multiple parties. The concept of concurrent delay is based upon the premise that when multiple parties independently contribute to an impact to the critical path, the party or parties causing the event should be responsible for their share of that project critical path impact. There can be concurrent delays between separate delay events both caused by the same party. However, in such case there is effectively no need for a concurrency analysis. Throughout this Recommended Practice, it has been assumed that concurrency exists only when it is caused by at least two separate parties or between at least one party and a force majeure event. While the allocation and distribution of concurrent delay impacts should always be based upon the terms and conditions of the contract, most contracts are silent on the subject of concurrent delay. This section is intended to identify and facilitate the calculation and apportionment of concurrent delay impacts.\n\nTypically, Owners assess liquidated/stipulated damages for non-excusable delay and Contractors claim entitlement to extended overhead reimbursement for compensable delay. In each case, the damages are typically calculated on the basis of a daily unit rate. Under most concurrent delay applications however, the Owner and Contractor time-related damages are not offset against each other when concurrent delay can be demonstrated. Typically, when both Contractor and Owner are concurrently responsible for an extended period of performance, the Contractor is granted an extension of contract time without compensation and the Owner forgoes the collection of liquidated/stipulated damages. No time-related compensation flows from either party to the other. Generally, therefore, substantial incentive exists for:\n\n1. The Contractor to demonstrate concurrent excusable delay during a period likely to be considered non-excusable delay; and\n\n2. The Owner to demonstrate concurrent non-excusable delay during a period likely to be considered excusable delay.\n\nAccordingly, both Owners and Contractors frequently contend that concurrent delays offset each other as a defense to excuse their potential liability to compensate the other party for time related costs.\n\nThe identification and quantification of concurrent delay is arguably the most contentious technical subject in forensic schedule analysis. Accordingly, it is important that all sides, if possible, agree on either the Literal or Functional theory (See Subsection 4.2.D.1.) employed in the identification and quantification of concurrent delay. Failing that, the analyst should be aware of the theory adopted by the opposing party.\n\nB. Various Definitions of Concurrency\n\nAACE Recommended Practice No. 10S-90 Cost Engineering Terminology, lists five different but similar definitions for concurrent delay.[4] As discussed more fully in the sections that follow, the five definitions reflect some of the differing opinions and applications associated with concurrent delay. The apparent contradictions underscore why this has become one of the most contentious areas of\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nANNEXURE 03\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n102 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nforensic schedule delay analysis.\n\n(1) Two or more delays that take place or overlap during the same period, either of which occurring alone would have affected the ultimate completion date. In practice, it can be difficult to apportion damages when the concurrent delays are due to the owner and contractor respectively.\n\n(2) Concurrent delays occur when there are two or more independent causes of delay during the same time period. The \u201csame\u201d time period from which concurrency is measured, however, is not always literally within the exact period of time. For delays to be considered concurrent, most courts do not require that the period of concurrent delay precisely match. The period of \u201cconcurrency\u201d of the delays can be related by circumstances, even though the circumstances may not have occurred during exactly the same time period.\n\n(3) True concurrent delay is the occurrence of two or more delay events at the same time, one an employer risk event, the other a contractor risk event and the effects of which are felt at the same time. The term \u201econcurrent delay\u201f is often used to describe the situation where two or more delay events arise at different times, but the effects of them are felt (in whole or in part) at the same time. To avoid confusion, this is more correctly termed the \u201econcurrent effect\u201f of sequential"

Early completion as it relates to compensation\n\nIf as a result of an Employer Delay, the Contractor is prevented from completing the works by the Contractor\u2019s planned completion date (being a date earlier than the contract completion date), the Contractor should in principle be entitled to be paid the costs directly caused by the Employer Delay, notwithstanding that there is no delay to the contract completion date (and therefore no entitlement to an EOT). However, this outcome will ensue only if at the time they enter into the contract, the Employer is aware of the Contractor\u2019s intention to complete the works prior to the contract completion date, and that intention is realistic and achievable.\n\n14. Concurrent delay \u2013 effect on entitlement to compensation for prolongation\n\nWhere Employer Delay to Completion and Contractor Delay to Completion are concurrent and, as a result of that delay the Contractor incurs additional costs, then the Contractor should only recover compensation if it is able to separate the additional costs caused by the Employer Delay from those caused by the Contractor Delay. If it would have incurred the additional costs in any event as a result of Contractor Delay, the Contractor will not be entitled to recover those additional costs.\n\n15. Mitigation of delay and mitigation of loss\n\nThe Contractor has a general duty to mitigate the effect on its works of Employer Risk Events. Subject to express contract wording or agreement to the contrary, the duty to mitigate does not extend to requiring the Contractor to add extra resources or to work outside its planned working hours. The Contractor\u2019s duty to mitigate its loss has two aspects: first, the Contractor must take reasonable steps to minimise its loss; and secondly, the Contractor must not take unreasonable steps that increase its loss.\n\n16. Acceleration\n\nWhere the contract provides for acceleration, payment for the acceleration should be based on the terms of the contract. Where the contract does not provide for acceleration but the Contractor and the Employer agree that accelerative measures should be undertaken, the basis of payment should be agreed before the acceleration is commenced. Contracting parties should seek to agree on the records to be kept when is considering acceleration measures are employed. Where implementing acceleration measures to avoid the risk of liquidated damages as a result of not receiving an EOT that it considers is due, and then pursuing a\n\nthe Contractor\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n7\n\nANNEXURE 02\n\nconstructive acceleration claim, the Contractor should first take steps to have the dispute or difference about entitlement to an EOT resolved in accordance with the contract dispute resolution provisions.\n\n17. Global claims\n\nThe not uncommon practice of contractors making composite or global claims without attempting to substantiate cause and effect is discouraged by the Protocol, despite an apparent trend for the courts to take a more lenient approach when considering global claims.\n\n18. Disruption claims\n\nCompensation may be recovered for disruption only to the extent that the contract permits or there is an available cause of action at law. The objective of a disruption analysis is to demonstrate the loss of productivity and hence additional loss and expense over and above that which would have been incurred were it not for the disruption events for which the Employer is responsible.\n\n19. Valuation of variations\n\nWhere practicable, the total likely effect of variations should be pre-agreed between the Employer/CA and the Contractor to arrive at, if possible, a fixed price of a variation, to include not only the direct costs (labour, plant and materials) but also the time-related and disruption costs, an agreed E"

            " transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nRevenue Recognition using the Cost-to-cost Method for Government Contracts in the Defense and Aerospace Division\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues for the CPS segment were $1.5 billion for the year ended September 28, 2024, of which the defense and aerospace division represents a portion of the segment. The Company recognizes revenue for defense and aerospace government contracts on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion), which management believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Recognition of revenue on government contracts requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition using the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs for such contracts and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence related to management\u2019s determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Also, as described in the \u201cOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management\u2019s process for developing the estimation of costs for a sample of defense and aerospace government contracts; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s determination of the estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs used involved (i) assessing management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate costs for government contracts by assessing the nature and status of government contracts; (ii) performing retrospective reviews of government contract estimates and changes in estimates over time; and (iii) obtaining evidence to support estimated costs.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California November 27, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2016.\n\n46\n\nTable of Contents\n\nSANMINA CORPORATION\n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\nASSETS\n\nCurrent assets:\n\nCash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable, net of allowances of approximately $7 million and $8 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively Contract assets Inventories Prepaid expenses and other current assets\n\nTotal current assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net Deferred income tax assets Other\n\nTotal assets\n\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nCurrent liabilities:\n\nAccounts payable Accrued liabilities Accrued payroll and related benefits Short-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt\n\nTotal current liabilities\n\nLong-term liabilities: Long-term debt Other\n\nTotal long-term liabilities Commitments and contingencies Stockholders' equity:\n\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, authorized 5,000 shares, none issued and outstanding Common stock, $0.01 par value, authorized 166,667 shares; 113,117 and 111,550 shares issued and 53,921 and 56,833 shares outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and September 30"

            " This relies upon contemporaneous records of direct works observations to determine productivity. If these records are not available, this method is unlikely to be persuasive, although factual witness evidence may assist. These observations, along with adjustments to construction methods and crews, might be recorded in tradesman questionnaires.\n\n(e)\n\nSystem dynamics modelling: This is a computer simulation approach using specialist software to produce a model of the disrupted project. That model replicates the complex network of relationships and interactions that influence labour productivity and rework including the various stages of the project (design, approvals, procurement or manufacturing, installation, construction, commissioning and taking over), the different parts of the works, workflows and project participants, and the direct effects of the claim events. The model reproduces the actual labour hour expenditures (including the as-built programme and added variations and other changes). The project is then re-simulated in the absence of the claim items resulting in a \u2018but-for\u2019 model. The robustness of the conclusions derived from this analysis is\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n47\n\ndependent upon: (a) the accuracy and completeness of the source input data and hence the quality and availability of project records; (b) the reasonableness of the analyst\u2019s judgements in establishing the model; and (c) the transparency of the analytical process carried out by the specialist software. Given these challenges and the complexity and cost involved in carrying out this analysis, it is not as commonly used as other methods in calculating loss of productivity.\n\nProject-comparison studies\n\n18.17 Project-comparison studies may be relied upon when there are insufficient records available to carry out a project-specific study. With this approach, productivity on the disrupted project is compared to similar or analogous projects (or similar or analogous work activities on other projects) within the same industry where the disruption events (and hence the productivity losses) did not occur. This approach depends on the availability of sufficient data from the comparator projects to ensure that the comparison is on a like-for-like basis, and to allow proper testing of alleged comparability. This approach will not be persuasive without transparency on the data from the comparator projects.\n\nIndustry studies\n\n18.18 Where there is insufficient contemporaneous documentation to support a project-specific study or project-comparison studies are not available, a productivity-loss estimate using data developed from studies based on industry- wide research may be of assistance, though only if these studies are relevant to the working conditions and types of construction that applies to the disrupted project.\n\n18.19 Here, factors generated from industry studies (some based on empirical data; some on non-empirical data) are relied upon to estimate lost productivity. These factors are applied to the disrupted project\u2019s actual resource losses in order to determine whether the level of loss measured on the disrupted project is consistent with the factors determined in those studies. For example, for projects that are disrupted by severe weather, these studies can provide factors which account for changes in temperature and their effects on tradesmen practices and productivity. Other studies address the consequences of different project or geographical characteristics on productivity. Examples of these industry studies are those developed by the Mechanical Contractors Association of America (MCAA), which give different percentages applicable for various types of disruption events according to severity, \u2018Effects of Accelerated Working, Delays and Disruption on Labour Productivity\u2019 produced by The Chartered Institute of Building, and studies produced by the National Electrical Contractors of America (NECA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Academic studies developed by university research, and available in specialist literature, may provide further assistance.\n\n18.20 Industry studies of these kinds, particularly where unsupported by corroborating data from the project in question, are however liable to be criticised as being theoretical and so should be used with caution.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n48\n\nCost-based methods\n\n18.21 Cost-based methods provide the least robust support for a disruption claim and are often applied when lost productivity cannot be reliably calculated utilising a productivity-based approach. These methods focus on project cost records and seek to provide a comparison between either incurred and estimated cost, or labour used and estimated labour, for those activities impacted by disruption events for which the Employer is responsible.\n\n18.22 Several formulae are available, the simplest being total labour cost expended (by the Contractor) less total labour cost paid (by the Employer to the Contractor), which equals total labour cost lost. However, for the reasons in paragraph 18.6 above, this approach is unlikely to be persuasive without further analysis. Modified formulae which exclude from the claimable costs calculation the costs of the Contractor\u2019s tender errors and any disruption events for which the Contractor is responsible will be more persuasive"

Accordingly, the Claimant\u2019s claimed value is flawed in my understanding.\n\n84.\n\nThe Chartered Accountants certificate states that costs are considered from 19 March 201654.

I have grouped these 97 cost heads into cost categories by considering these of similar nature under one cost category.\n\n86.1.\n\nI note that cost head under GL code MP IS costs related to Labour / Direct manpower expenses. Therefore, I have grouped the same under cost category (s) - Labour / Direct manpower related costs.\n\n86.2.\n\nI note that cost heads under GL code 421001 to 425018 are costs related to various components of compensation provided to staff and related manpower expenses. Therefore, I have grouped the same under cost category (s) - Salaries and other manpower related costs\n\n86.3.\n\nI note that cost heads under GL code 441001 to 441005 are costs pertaining to rent of guest houses, site offices etc. Therefore, I have grouped the same under cost category (s) - Rental Charges for establishments.\n\n86.4.\n\nI note that cost heads under GL code 442001 to 444007 are costs pertaining to repair and maintenance expenses of different equipment.

My conclusion is that in the absence of justification of basis of calculation and lack of supporting documentary evidence (which should have been audited by charted accountant), I am unable to assess the Claimant\u2019s claim.\n\n4.3\n\nClaim-2: Costs on Account of Head Office Overhead\n\n4.3.1 The Claimant\u2019s Stand\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant claims an amount of INR 268,698,08961 on account of head office overhead cost during extended period of 1596 days i.e., 19 March 2016 to 31 July 2020. The Claimant stated that head office overheads had been computed using the Eichleay Formulae62.\n\n4.3.2 The Respondent\u2019s Stand\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent has denied the Claimant\u2019s claim towards head office overhead costs stating it to be false and baseless. The Respondent has disputed and denied application of Eichleay Formula stating that the Claimant itself is responsible for the various delays and has also failed to place the contemporary evidences of actual expenditure on record63.\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent has further indicated that the CA certificate submitted by the Claimant is only based on books of accounts and not on the verification of the contemporary records. The Respondent has concluded that in absence of verification of any contemporary records by the CA, its certificate cannot form the basis of award towards the Claimant\u2019s claim64.\n\n4.3.3 My Observations\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimant has included its\u2019 auditor\u2019s certificate in support of the claimed amount65.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant has calculated the prolongation cost for MS-1 only and considered the alleged delay period from 19 March 2016 to 31 July 202066. I understand that during this alleged period, the Claimant was also executing the works under MS-2 and MS-3. Therefore, this alleged delay period for MS-1 was running parallel to execution of works under MS-2 & MS- 3. Hence, I opine that there appears to be duplication of cost.\n\n61 SoC, Volume II, Annexure B of Appendix C, Page 457 62 SoC, Volume I, Page 93, Paragraph 75 63 SoD, Page 207-209, Paragraph 73-75 64 SoD, Page 207-209, Paragraph 73-75 65 SoC, Volume II, Appendix-C, Page 437 66 SoC, Volume II, Annexure B of Appendix C, Page 457\n\nExpert Report on Quantum by Shishir Kant Privileged and Confidential Page 31 of 73\n\nIn the matter of Arbitration \u2013 TATA Aldesa JV Vs.

My analysis covered the period from 14 March 2013 to 31 December 2020. This period\n\nis broadly divided into following sub-periods:\n\na. Period of achievement of Milestone 1: This covers\n\nthe period from commencement of the Contract to the actual achievement of MS 1. The achievement of MS-1 was granted on 31 July 2020. Hence, I considered the end date of this sub-period till 31 July 2020.\n\nb. Period from achievement of Milestone 1 to TOC*: The TOC* was issued effective from 17 December 2020; however, I noted that the miscellaneous activities continued in all sections and concluded on 31 December 2020. Therefore, this sub-period covers the period from 01 August 2020 to 31 December 2020.\n\n8.1 MY OPINION ON MILESTONE 1\n\n594.\n\nI have investigated the causes of delay to the achievement of Milestone 1 and have explained them in the previous sections. The delay in achievement of MS 1 was due to the identified critical activities of the respective sections. The apportionment and their respective attributability is presented in this section.\n\n8.2\n\nCRITICALITY OF DELAY EVENTS: SECTION-WISE\n\n595. Based upon the construction sequence and the common sense approach, I have identified the Critical delay events for the respective Sections. These Critical delay events controlled and ultimately drove the completion of the Section and further the achievement of the Contract Milestones.\n\n596. Apart from the other delay events, my consolidated list of delay events also consists of\n\ndelays in land handover on some Chainages for each Section.\n\n597. While identifying the Critical delay events out of the delays pertaining to land handover as discussed above, I identified the chainage for which 1st layer of Ballast works were completed at last, from the list of chainages affected by the delay in handover of land.\n\n598. The, I backtracked the predecessor activities and assumed that all of the activities at the above identified chainage became critical due to delay in land handover at this chainage. Thus, making the land handover at this chainage itself",
            " critical.\n\n599. Then I compared the completion date of 1st layer of ballast on the above assumed Chainages from that on the un-affected Chainages due to delay in land handover.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Expert Report on Delay by Rohit Singhal Privileged and Confidential Page 142 of 175\n\nIn the matter of arbitration \u2013 Tata Aldesa JV Vs.

Then the assumption is wrong and the assumed critical delay in land hand over at the affected chainage is actually not critical.\n\n601. However, in reverse condition the assumption is right and the assumed critical delay\n\npertaining to land handover is actually critical.\n\n602.

        "question": "How could new SEC rules impact compliance costs and mgmt's time?",

        "contexts": [
            " the new revenue recognition standard, which is complex and requires significant management judgment. Although we believe the judgments we applied in implementation of the new revenue recognition standard are appropriate, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to change our judgments relating to implementation of such standard in the future, whether as a result of new guidance or otherwise. A significant change in our accounting judgments could have a significant impact on our reported revenue, gross profit, assets and liabilities. In general, changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.\n\nOur system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures was designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. However, no\n\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. As a result, there can be no assurance that our system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors, theft and fraud, or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner. For example, as disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we have identified material weaknesses in the control environment at one of our divisions due in part to the division maintaining an inappropriate tone at the top. This division accounted for approximately 3% of our revenues on an annual basis.\n\n37\n\nFinally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and policy positions taken by large institutional stockholders and proxy advisors. As a result, the number of rules, regulations and standards applicable to us may become more burdensome to comply with, could increase scrutiny of our practices and policies by these or other groups and increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to governance and compliance activities. For example, the SEC has recently adopted rules requiring that issuers provide significantly increased disclosures concerning cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting and adopt more stringent executive compensation clawback policies and California has enacted legislation that will require large companies doing business in the state to provide significant disclosures concerning their greenhouse gas emissions and financial risks relating to climate change. Increasing regulatory burdens and corporate governance requirements could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors and qualified executive officers.\n\nLiquidity and Credit Risks\n\nOur customers could experience credit problems, which could reduce our future revenues and net income.\n\nCertain of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties in the past, with a few filing for bankruptcy. Financial difficulties experienced\n\nby one or more of our customers, could negatively affect our business by decreasing demand from such customers and through the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that additional customers will not declare bankruptcy or suffer financial distress, in which case our future revenues, net income and cash flow could be reduced.\n\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain or expand our operations, which would reduce the amount of business our customers and vendors are able to do with us and impact our ability to continue operations at current levels without seeking additional funding; increasing interest rates will reduce our net income and operating cash flow; we could experience losses if one or more financial institutions holding our cash or other financial counterparties were to fail; repatriation of foreign cash could increase our taxes.\n\nOur liquidity is dependent on a number of factors, including profitability, business volume, inventory levels, the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, the degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers with payment terms granted to our customers, the amount we invest in our facilities and equipment, the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, the schedule for repayment of our outstanding indebtedness, the timing of stock repurchases, the amount available to borrow under our credit agreement and the amount of accounts receivable eligible for sale under our factoring programs. In the event we need or desire additional liquidity beyond the sources described above to maintain or expand our business levels, make acquisitions or repurchase stock, there can be no assurance that such additional liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The sale of receivables under our factoring programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired. In addition, because the interest rate we pay for borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the interest rate used to calculate the purchase price for receivables under our factoring programs are variable, recent sustained increases in interest rates resulting from actions taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce inflation both increases the amount of interest expense we pay, which reduces net income, and also reduces"

Based on these glaring breaches by the Claimant, the engineer while granting extension of time had rightfully imposed delay damages upon the Claimant. The second extension of time granted through Letter dated 02.03.2017, was the first occasion when the engineer imposed delay damages upon the Claimant. Thereafter the engineer on several occasions while taking note of the ground reality which clearly show delays on part of the Claimant, it went ahead and imposed delay damages upon the Claimant.\u201d\n\n197.

The Respondent states146 \u201c\u2026in the future the DFC is envisaged to accommodate other rail users authorized by Ministry of Railways (\u201cMoR\u201d). DFCs have been created with the hope that new operators will help to increase the overall share of railways and improve the overall efficiency of the Indian rail network through innovative transport solutions. In order for this to occur IR and DFCCIL need to develop a regime for setting Track Access Charges (TACs) and allocating capacity on the DFCs in a non-discriminatory manner which encourages new operators to enter the market\u201d.\n\n207. The Respondent also states147 \u201cSometime in 2017 DFCCIL/MoR had engaged KPMG to review the global practice in relation to levy of TAC in similar freight corridors and based on the global experience recommend the options for setting the initial TAC for DFCC. The said agency after detailed review had made its recommendation which are attached along with the present Counter Claim as Annexure RC-1(Colly).\u201d\n\n208.

With the help of above presented table, the inordinate delay in each activity of the RFO\n\nworks in this Section can be seen.\n\n584.\n\nIt is understood from the above that the construction works, i.e., test piling works were started on 03 June 2015638 for ET MJ 1 and the working pile was started on 08 July 2015639.\n\n585. The substructure works of RFO ET MJ 1 were completed on 27 February 2018640. The claimant took 1000 days to complete the substructure works from the start of test piling works.\n\n586. Then, it is surprising to note that the erection of Girders for ET MJ 1 was started on 11\n\nMay 2019641, i.e., 438 days after the completion of the substructure works.\n\n587. Thereafter the Claimant took further 705 days to complete the RFO works up Erection of\n\nGirder of ET MJ 1, that were completed on 02 February 2020642.\n\n588. The balance works including the finishing works were completed on 01 January 2021643, i.e., 334 days after the completion of Girder Erection of ET MJ 1.\n\n589. Thus, the Claimant took a total of 2005 days to complete this RFO. This delay is\n\nattributable to the Claimant due to slow progress of works.\n\n590.

I have identified and listed the respective causation to the various construction activities. Due these delays the track linking works were delayed.\n\n592. Also, I find that the miscellaneous construction works and finishing works for both the Minor and Major structures including Rail Fly Over, were completed very slowly after the completion of the respective deck slab works.\n\n593.\n\nI noted that the completion of the Track linking of all the sections will mark the achievement of the Milestone 1. From the above section, I have identified the activities which were critical to the completion of the Track linking/laying for the respective section.\n\n594.\n\nIt is understood that the Track linking/laying was completed in the order of Section 3 then Section 2 and in last Section 1.\n\n595.\n\nI have also noted that the As-Built dates and their respective delay for the procurement of the Ballast and the rails for Track laying.

Business\n\nOverview\n\nSanmina Corporation (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cSanmina\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. We provide these comprehensive offerings primarily to original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) in the following industries: industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure. Our customer-focused organization with 37,000 employees, including 5,000 temporary employees, supports our customers from 21 countries on four continents. We locate our facilities near our customers and their end markets in major centers for the electronics industry or in lower-cost locations. The combination of our advanced technologies, extensive manufacturing expertise and economies of scale enables us to meet the specialized needs of our customers. All references in this report to years refer to our fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\n\nOur end-to-end solutions, combined with our global supply chain management expertise, allow us to manage our customers' products throughout their\n\nlife cycles. These solutions include:\n\nproduct design and engineering, including concept development, detailed design, prototyping, validation, preproduction services and manufacturing design release and product industrialization;\n\nmanufacturing of components, subassemblies and complete systems;\n\nhigh-level assembly and test;\n\ndirect order fulfillment and logistics services;\n\nafter-market product service and support; and\n\nglobal supply chain management.\n\nWe manage our operations as two businesses:\n\n1) Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (\u201cIMS\u201d). Our IMS business consists of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment. This segment generated approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2024.\n\n2) Components, Products and Services (\u201cCPS\u201d). Components include advanced printed circuit boards (\u201cPCBs\u201d), backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) and microelectronic design and manufacturing services from our Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace products, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from our SCI Technology, Inc.

CPS generated approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2024.\n\nWe target markets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and in which OEMs sell complex mission critical products that are subject to strict regulatory requirements and/or rapid technological change. We believe these markets offer an opportunity to deliver higher margins as they require higher value-added manufacturing services and provide better opportunities for us to sell customers our advanced vertically integrated components. In addition, diversification across market segments and customers helps mitigate our dependency on any market or customer. We report our end markets as follows:\n\n1) Industrial"

The tax rate was lower for the three months ended April 1, 2023 due to favorable discrete tax items.\n\nOur provision for income taxes for the six months ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022 was $47 million (21% of income\n\nbefore taxes) and $41 million (28% of income before taxes), respectively. The tax rate was lower for the six months ended April 1, 2023 due to favorable discrete tax items, including the recognition of an $8 million tax benefit that resulted from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.\n\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\n\nOn October 3, 2022, we completed a joint venture transaction pursuant to a Share Subscription and Purchase Agreement (the\n\n\u201cSSPA\u201d) and a Joint Venture and Shareholders\u2019 Agreement (the \u201cShareholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d) previously entered into with Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (\u201cRSBVL\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. Pursuant to the SSPA and the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement, the parties established Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (\u201cSIPL\u201d), our existing Indian manufacturing entity, as a joint venture to engage in manufacturing in India of telecommunications equipment, data center and internet equipment, medical equipment, clean technology equipment and other high-tech equipment. This partnership leverages our advanced manufacturing experience and RSBVL\u2019s expertise and leadership in the Indian business ecosystem. In addition to supporting our current customer base, the joint venture will create a state-of-the-art \u2018Manufacturing Technology Center of Excellence\u2019 that will serve as an incubation center to support the product development and hardware start-up ecosystem in India, as well as promote research and innovation of leading-edge technologies.\n\nAs a result of the transaction, RSBVL acquired shares of SIPL for approximately $216 million of cash such that RSBVL holds\n\n50.1% of the outstanding shares of SIPL and we hold the remaining 49.9% of the outstanding shares of SIPL. In connection with RSBVL\u2019s investment, Sanmina and RSBVL entered into a management services contract pursuant to which Sanmina has the unilateral ability to make the significant financial and operating decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL\u2019s business.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, we are required to consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial\n\ninterest. We determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, we have a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, we have, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL\u2019s business. Because we have a controlling financial interest in SIPL, we continue to consolidate SIPL. However, we periodically assess whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require us to deconsolidate SIPL.\n\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the three and six months ended April 1, 2023 was $6 million and $9\n\nmillion, respectively.\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\n(In thousands)\n\nNet cash provided by (used in): Operating activities Investing activities Financing activities Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents Increase (Decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n\n$\n\n$\n\n101,802 (101,488) 185,837 2,195 188,346\n\n$\n\n$\n\nKey Working Capital Management Measures\n\nAs of\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nDays sales outstanding (1) Contract asset days (2) Inventory turns (3) Days inventory on hand (4) Accounts payable days (5) Cash cycle days (6)\n\n49 18 5.2 70 85 52\n\n(1)\n\nDays sales outstanding (a measure of how quickly we collect our accounts receivable), or \u201cDSO\u201d, is calculated as the ratio of average accounts receivable, net, to average daily net sales for the quarter.\n\n(2)\n\nContract asset days (a measure of how quickly we transfer contract assets to accounts receivable) are calculated as the ratio of average contract assets to average daily net sales for the quarter.\n\n(3)\n\nInventory turns (annualized) (a measure of how quickly we sell inventory) are calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average inventory.\n\n(4)\n\nDays inventory on"
