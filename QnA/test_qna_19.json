During the track laying operation at Crossing & Junction Stations the majority of the fastenings are clipped within neutral temperature range so no de-stressing is required and the track is welded immediately using a Mobile Flash Butt Welding process. When this does not occur the track is unfastened progressively over each long welded rail panel with the central section of the panel remaining fully fastened. The rail temperature is measured, and accordingly required rail gap between panels shall be created either by cutting the rail ends or pulling the rail up (if rail temperature is less than neutral temperature range) using rail tensors in Mobile Flash Butt Welder.

            ", automation, analytics, service assurance, and consumer broadband experience. Via our DZS Xtreme solutions we offer a commercial, carrier- grade network-slicing enabled orchestration platform complementing our position with physical network devices supporting Open RAN (\u201cO- RAN\u201d) and 4G/5G networks. Communications service providers are implementing software defined networking (\u201cSDN\u201d) and network functions virtualization (\u201cNFV\u201d) architectures to reduce reliance on proprietary systems and hardware, which increase service agility, flexibility, and deployment of new network services while lowering costs. Our Expresse software solution provides a clear view of multi-vendor, multi- technology access networks for both network and service assurance while monitoring, identifying, diagnosing, and fixing network problems via an artificial intelligence (AI) based recommendation engine. CloudCheck software is an advanced WiFi experience management and analytics solution that enables communications service providers to monitor, manage and optimize home WiFi networks. DZS customers are implementing experience and service assurance solutions to reduce support costs, including specifically the costs of WiFi troubleshooting and truck rolls, improve service performance and customer satisfaction, and ultimately reduce subscriber churn and increase average revenue per user (ARPU).\n\nIndustry Background\n\nExpansion in our worldwide business is driven by the increased demand of subscribers and cloud service providers for mobile and fixed network access solutions and communications equipment that enable or support access to higher speed bandwidth access to the internet.\n\nFurthermore, increased competition between service providers for subscriber business has resulted in significant investment pressure to upgrade network infrastructure to meet growing bandwidth needs. Broadband access networks must be multiservice in nature and must have extensive quality of service guarantees in order to support 5G, mobile xHaul, symmetric business services and residential services, as well as virtual overlay networks for alternative operators and wholesale access.\n\nIn recent years, the growth of social communications and networking has placed significant demands on legacy access infrastructure, which was exacerbated in 2020 by the global COVID-19 pandemic which drove a dramatic rise in remote work and learning as well as entertainment streaming. This increased demand has been challenging for the industry, even for the newest and most advanced providers. Increased subscriber usage of smartphone, video streaming services, PC gaming services and high definition and ultra-high-definition televisions has increased the network throughput demand driven by music, pictures, user-generated content (as found on many video-sharing sites) and high-definition video, which have all become a growing part of subscribers\u2019 regular exchange of information.\n\nTrends such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Cloud-based services, Internet of Things (IoT), and 5G have also increased the demand for broadband network access and customer premises solutions. All these new technologies share a common dependency on high-bandwidth communication networks and sophisticated traffic management tools. As bandwidth demands continue to increase, carriers need to continue to upgrade their network infrastructure to support such demand. The infrastructure upgrade cycle typically has the effect of moving bandwidth bottlenecks from one part of the network to another (such as a carrier\u2019s access network, core network or data centers), depending on the selection of technology and costs.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged in the industry that a fiber-optic broadband access network is the preferred network architecture for a broadband fixed network. This network architecture is commonly called Fiber to the Premises (\u201cFTTP\u201d) for business subscribers or Fiber to the Home (\u201cFTTH\u201d) for residential subscribers. With FTTH, all services are generally delivered at the premise through smart optical networking terminal units (\u201cONT\u201d). The Fiber to the Node (\u201cFTTN\u201d) architecture is also deployed where the fiber-optic cable terminates at a street cabinet which contains a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (\u201cDSLAM\u201d) or Multiple Service Access Node (\u201cMSAN\u201d) that then provides higher speed services to their customers over the last mile legacy copper wireline infrastructure. With the shift away from the legacy copper telephone Time-division Multiplexing (\u201cTDM\u201d) switches (used in carrier networks from the 1980\u2019s to the early 2000\u2019s), many carriers that continue to provide services over copper wireline networks are decommissioning their legacy telephone switches and moving services over to Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) platforms via an MSAN/Softswitch solution. Our broadband access products and solutions are designed to address all these fiber configurations, commonly referred to as FTTx, by allowing carriers and service providers to either use fiber-optic networks or leverage their existing deployed copper networks to offer broadband services to customer premises. The demand for FTTx is also driven by various government sponsored broadband stimulus funding programs. These initiatives cultivate broadband opportunities around the world. Several of the most prominent initiatives are in North America, including American Rescue Plan"

        "contexts": [
            " in this way, the positions of the joints are always obvious, even when the concrete is given a textured finish.\n\n(5)\n\nIf substantial changes in the cross section of a member are necessary, the jOints should be formed where they minimise stresses caused by temperature gradients and shrinkage.\n\n(6)\n\nJoints should be located away from regions of maximum stress caused by loading, particularly where shear and bond stress are high. Construction joints between slabs and ribs in composite beam should be avoided. As a general rule, joints in column are made as near as possible to the beam hunching, joints in beams and slabs should normally be made at the centre or within the middle third of the span.\n\n9.12.6\n\nPreparing the surface of the Joint\n\n(1)\n\nThe minimum number of joints should be used and their construction should be simple. They should be either horizontal or vertical, because concreting sloping surfaces are usually unsatisfactory.\n\n(2) Where concrete is placed in vertical members e.g. walls, columns and the like, the lift of concrete shall finish level or at right angles to the axis of the member, the joint line matching the features of the finished work. Concreting shall be carried out continuously upto the construction joint.\n\n(3)\n\nLaitance, both on the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the concrete, should be removed before fresh concrete is cast. The surface should be roughened to promote good adhesion. Various methods for removal can be used but they should not dislodge the coarse aggregate particles. Concrete may be brushed with a stiff brush soon after casting while the concrete is still fresh, and while it has only slightly stiffened.\n\n(4)\n\nIf the concrete has partially hardened, it may be treated by wire brushing or with a high pressure water jet, followed by drying with an air jet, immediately before the new concrete is placed.\n\n(5)\n\nFully hardened concrete should be treated with mechanical hand tools or grill blasting, taking care not to split or crack aggregate particles.\n\n(6)\n\nThe best time for treating the joint is a matter of judgment because it depends on the rate of setting and hardening (which is itself dependent on the temperature of the concrete). Before further concrete is cast, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned to remove debris and accumulated rubbish, one effective method, being air jet.\n\n(7)\n\n131\n\n~ __ 759\n\nDedicated Freight Corridor Project (Western Corridor Phase-2) Package CT P-12 Civil, Building and Track Works (Vaitarana -Sachin Section)\n\nBid Documents - Volume III\n\nparticularly aggressive and there has been a substantial delay between lifts, the concrete should be cut back to expose the bars for a length of about 50mm to ensure that contaminated concrete is removed.\n\n(8)\n\nIn all cases, when construction joints are made, to essential it is ensure that the jOint surface is not contaminated with release agents, dust or curing membrane, and that the reinforcement is fixed firmly in position at the correct cover.\n\n9.12.7 Concreting at Construction Joints\n\n(1) When the form work is fixed for the next lift, it should be inspected to ensure that no leakage can occur from the fresh concrete. It is a good practice to fix a 6mm thick sponge which seals the gap completely.\n\n(2)\n\nThe practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout is not recommended. The old surface should be soaked with water without leaving puddles, immediately before starting concreting, then the new concrete should be thoroughly compacted against it. When fresh concrete is cast against existing mature concrete or masonry, the older surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned and soaked to prevent the absorption of water from the new concrete. Standing water should be removed shortly before the new concrete is placed and the new concrete should be thoroughly vibrated in the region of the joint.\n\n9.12.8\n\nIn case of concreting in sea water, no construction joints shall be allowed within 600mm below low water level or within 600mm of upper and lower planes of wave action.\n\n9.13\n\nConcreting Under Water\n\n9.13.1 When it is necessary to deposit concrete under water, the methods, equipment, materials and proportions of mix to be used shall be subject to the consent of the Engineer before any work is started. The weight of the coarse aggregates shall not be less than one and half times, not more than twice that of the fine aggregates.\n\n9.13.2 Concrete shall not be placed in water having a temperature below 5 degrees Celsius, The temperature of the concrete, when deposited, shall not be less than 16 degrees CelSius, nor"
