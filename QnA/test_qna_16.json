Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\nRisk Management and Strategy\n\nCybersecurity risks are classified as a Tier 1 risk within our enterprise risk management program. We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of our systems, networks, databases and applications. We routinely invest to develop and implement numerous cybersecurity programs and processes, including risk management and assessment programs, security and event monitoring capabilities, detailed incident response plans, and other advanced detection, prevention and protection\n\n30\n\ncapabilities, including practices and tools to monitor and mitigate insider threats. We regularly assess cybersecurity risks to identify and enumerate threats to us and vulnerabilities these threats can exploit to adversely impact our business operations. In some instances, we engage third parties to conduct or assist us with conducting cybersecurity risk assessments.\n\nOur cybersecurity program employs various risk-tracking tools, industry data, monitoring, detection and response tools, vulnerability scanning, security dashboards and scorecards and other tools to support our continued evaluation of cybersecurity threats and regulatory requirements. Our cybersecurity program addresses the continuously evolving and extensive attack vectors and methods through layered security controls informed by constant threat analysis. Threats include a wide variety of perpetrators aiming for political, personal or financial gain, utilizing a broad set of tactics including ransomware, advanced malware, DDoS, account takeover, phishing/SMSing and social engineering, among others. These risks threaten our internal systems as well as third-party systems that we use and rely upon for the delivery of services and support of our operations. Our risk mitigation techniques include technology risk management, network segmentation, deployment of enhanced detection tools across our network, systems, databases, and applications and monitoring compliance with security standards.\n\nVarious security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks, including the voluntary framework released by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (\u201cNIST\u201d) in 2014 and updated in 2018, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure. The NIST cybersecurity framework provides a prioritized and flexible model for organizations to identify and manage cyber risks inherent to their business. Our security infrastructure is comprised of multiple security capabilities designed with a defense-in-depth model informed by the NIST cybersecurity framework, as well as a variety of other industry standards and best practices. The risk-based approach of the NIST cybersecurity framework has enabled us to implement cybersecurity programs tailored to our particular network architectures, customer environments and institutional resources.\n\nOur cybersecurity risk management program also attempts to assess third-party vendor, service provider, business partner and supply chain risk management issues. Our efforts aim to better understand the cybersecurity posture of our third-party vendors, service providers, business partners and suppliers by analyzing their cybersecurity risk management programs. Our third-party cybersecurity risk management processes include reviewing and revising our service provider and vendor management programs and the related agreements to require prompt notification of cyber incidents, outages and", " software vulnerabilities to facilitate timely assessment and disclosure of third-party cyber risks. Generally, our agreements require our third-party providers to abide by specific privacy, confidentiality and security processes, particularly for third-party data-processing activities. For vendors that offer software as a service solutions involving personal information, our third-party risk management program generally requires third-party attestation of their security practices such as a System and Organization Controls 2 report or ISO27001 certification. Our due diligence and selection processes also require third parties to complete a cybersecurity and data privacy questionnaire that includes questions about contractor track record. Our third-party security reviews are limited by their disclosures; therefore, a risk-based approach is used in making vendor and contractual decisions based on those disclosures and the totality of the circumstances, such as whether the third party will have access to personal information or our network.\n\nAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition. For further discussion of cybersecurity risks, see \u201cPart I. Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to Our Business \u2013 Various events could disrupt or result in unauthorized access to our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results.\u201d\n\nGovernance\n\nOur organizational objectives are aligned to address our cybersecurity risks and management plays a pivotal role in assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Management\u2019s role in assessing and managing material cybersecurity risks includes various management positions and committees responsible for assessing such risks. Our internal processes require escalation of material cybersecurity risks to our executive leadership and Charter's Board of Directors, as well as management and committees who are tasked with the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. These processes provide guidance for consistent and effective incident handling and response and set standards for internal notifications and escalations, as well as external notification considerations with respect to a cybersecurity event or incident requiring disclosure or notification to a state and/or federal agency or affected customers.\n\nCharter's Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of our privacy and data security, including cybersecurity, risk exposures, policies and practices, including the steps management have taken to detect, monitor and control such risks and the potential impact of those exposures on our business, financial results, operations and reputation. Charter's\n\n31\n\nAudit Committee receives quarterly updates on the enterprise risk management program, including information on cybersecurity risks and initiatives undertaken to identify, assess and mitigate such risks. This cybersecurity reporting may include threat and incident reporting, vulnerability detection reporting, risk mitigation metrics, systems and security operations updates or internal audit observations, if applicable.\n\nWe have a unified cybersecurity leadership team, composed of members of our Security Executive Steering Committee (\u201cSecurity ESC\u201d) to oversee implementation of appropriate cybersecurity protections and promote accountability. The Security ESC is led by senior executives in our information technology (\"IT\") and technology operations groups and is comprised of senior executive leaders across the organization with the goal of driving cybersecurity focus through not just technical teams, but the entire business. The Security ESC reviews and evaluates current cyber threats and risks and improvements to our program and provides quarterly updates to the Chief Executive Officer as well as ad hoc updates on urgent matters. We also have a Cyber Security Council (\u201cCSC\u201d) and Security Operations Steering Committee that, under the direction of the Security ESC, collectively focus on cybersecurity across Charter and the overall protection of our internal network and related processes, policy, training and actions to protect customer and employee data. The CSC is comprised of senior leaders across the organization and operates under the auspices of the Security ESC, which is ultimately accountable under our enterprise risk management program for cybersecurity.\n\nOur Executive Vice President, Technology Operations and our Executive Vice President, Software Development & IT collectively oversee our cybersecurity program. Our Executive Vice President, Technology Operations is responsible for operating our customer product technology infrastructure across our 41-state footprint. He has served in various network operations roles at Charter since 2016 and previously held various engineering roles at other large public companies. Our Executive Vice President, Software Development & IT leads software development, security, technical integration, and IT. He has served in various software and engineering roles at Charter since 2016, and has previously held various IT roles, including chief information officer, at other telecommunications companies.\n\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (\u201cCISO\u201d) is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional and has served in various roles in information security at Charter since 2020. He has over two decades of experience in cybersecurity, corporate security and network operations, including cyber threat intelligence, vulnerability management, security operations, incident response, information security engineering and architecture, risk management and security awareness.\n\nItem 2.

We held $645 million and $601 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in cash paid for taxes, higher cash paid for interest and the payment of litigation settlements offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $986 million.\n\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $9.1 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. The increase in cash used was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures, offset by changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures that increased by $473 million.\n\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $3.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest offset by a decrease in the amount by which borrowings of long-term debt exceeded repayments.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures were $9.4 billion and $7.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in line extensions and customer premise equipment. The increase in line extensions was primarily due to the rural construction initiative. See the table below for more details.\n\nWe currently expect full year 2023 capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. We expect 2023 line extensions capital expenditures to approximate $4 billion. The actual amount of capital expenditures in 2023 will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of our network evolution and rural construction initiatives, supply chain timing and growth rates in our residential and commercial businesses.\n\nOur capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility.

Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11.1 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $2.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest partly offset by a decrease in the amount by which borrowings of long-term debt exceeded repayments.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures were $11.1 billion and $9.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in line extensions in connection with our subsidized rural construction initiative and continued residential and commercial network expansion. The increase in capital expenditures excluding line extensions was primarily driven by higher spend on network evolution, support capital and customer premise equipment, particularly Xumo. See the table below for more details.\n\nWe currently expect full year 2024 capital expenditures to total between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion.

Mobile services are sold under unlimited data plans or by-the-gig data usage plans. The Company often provides multiple services to a customer. The transaction price for a bundle of services may be less than the sum of the standalone selling prices of each individual service. The Company allocates the bundle discount among the services to which the discount relates based on the relative standalone selling prices of those services. Generally, directly observable standalone selling prices are used for the revenue allocation. Customers are invoiced for subscription services in advance of the service period. Each subscription service provided is accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and revenue is recognized ratably over the monthly service period as the subscription services are delivered. Residential customers may generally cancel their subscriptions at the end of their monthly service period without penalty. Each optional service purchased is generally accounted for as a distinct performance obligation when purchased and revenue is recognized when the service is provided. For customer premise equipment (\"CPE\") where such CPE would qualify as a lease, the Company combines the operating lease with the subscription service revenue as a single performance obligation as the"], "metadata": [{"source": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/16/CHTR_10-K_1706832000.pdf", "filename": "/Users/rohitjindal/del/Mimir/datasets/16/CHTR_10-K_1706832000.pdf"}], "answer_relevancy": [0.0], "answer_correctness": [0.1893011893175268], "semantic_similarity": [0.7572047572701072]}, {"question": "How does the updated Stockholders Agreement impact transaction approvals with A/N or Liberty at 20%+ voting interest, and which deals are affected?", "ground_truth": "For so long as either A/N or Liberty has a Voting Interest or Equity Interest equal to or greater than 20%, any Change of Control shall require the approval of a majority of the full Board of Directors and a majority of the Unaffiliated Directors.

These include degradation or disruption of our network, products and services, excessive call volume to call centers, theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, disruption of the security of our internal systems, products, services or satellite transmission signals, power outages, and the compromise of confidential or technical business information or damage to our or our customers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 data, equipment and reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from any of the foregoing events likely would not be sufficient to fully cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for disruptions to our business that may result. In addition, any such events could lead to litigation or cause regulators in the United States and internationally to impose significant fines or other remedial measures, including with respect to relevant customer privacy rules, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our company. Despite our efforts, we expect that we will continue to experience such incidents in the future, and there can be no assurance that any such incident will not have an adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in the United States, in Europe or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services, including advertising, and have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers\u2019 discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming and other OTT services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks. In particular, the success of our theme parks and theatrical releases largely depends on consumer demand for out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, could increase the cost of our borrowings and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\nAcquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions and investments and may pursue other strategic initiatives, such as Peacock. In connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur significant or unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n29\n\nComcast 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide.

Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, Euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations.

NBCUniversal and Sky have multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events, such as for the NFL, the Olympics and European football leagues, which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations. Cable Communications\u2019 programming expenses related to the distribution of third-party programmed channels are generally acquired under multiyear distribution agreements, with fees typically based on the number of customers that receive the programming and the extent of distribution. As a result, the amounts included in the table above under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments for these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than the amounts included above. We have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 36% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, of which the vast majority related to multiyear sports rights agreements.
