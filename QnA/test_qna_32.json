While we have certain ESG initiatives at the Company, there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, and employees will determine that these programs are sufficiently robust. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our announced goals related to our ESG program, as statements regarding our ESG goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them within the timelines we announce or at all. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our ESG initiatives, including our diversity initiatives, and reporting can impact our ability to hire and retain employees, increase our customer base, reelect our board of directors, or attract and retain certain types of investors. In addition, these parties are increasing focused on specific disclosures and frameworks related to ESG matters. Collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to evolving reporting standards, and can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material impact on us, including on our reputation and stock price. Inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could subject us to potential liability related to such information. In addition, several U.S. states having enacted or proposed \u201canti-ESG\u201d policies or legislation. While these policies and legislation are generally targeted to investment advisory firms and mutual funds, if these investors viewed our ESG practices including our climate-related goals and commitments, as being in contradiction of such \u201canti-ESG\u201d policies, such investors may not invest in the Company and it could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\n\nA portion of the business we acquired in fiscal 2021 requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (\u201cFOCI\u201d). Because we were organized in Bermuda at the time of this acquisition, we entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the business involving facility clearances. After our domestication, we requested and have now received partial release from some of these obligations. The remaining measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected.\n\nWe are a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government or its subcontractors. Our contracts with the U.S. government or its subcontractors are\n\nsubject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with the U.S. government or its subcontractors could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.\n\nNew technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. In the United States, there are various\n\ncurrent and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.\n\nWe are currently, and have been in the past, named as a party to several lawsuits, government inquiries or investigations and other legal proceedings\n\n(referred to as \u201clitigation\u201d), and we may be named in additional litigation in the future.

These outflows were partially offset by $87.6 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our equity incentive plans.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities of $980.2 million in fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to $1.6 billion repayment of debt principal, $223.7\n\nmillion for withholding tax paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement, $206.8 million payment for our quarterly dividends, $150.3 million payments for technology license obligations, and $150.0 million repurchases of common stock. These outflows were partially offset by $1.3 billion proceeds from issuance of debt, and $99.2 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our equity incentive plans.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nPlease see \u201cNote 2 \u2013 Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set\n\nforth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRelated Party Transactions\n\nNone.\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate Risk. With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse\n\nchanges in interest rates on our outstanding 2026 Term Loan. See \u201cNote 7 \u2013 Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. A hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1 percentage point could result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense by approximately $5.1 million.\n\nWe maintain an investment policy that requires minimum credit ratings, diversification of credit risk and limits the long-term interest rate risk by requiring effective maturities of generally less than five years. We typically invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments including money market funds and time deposits. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. There were no such investments on hand at February 1, 2025, aside from cash and cash equivalents.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk. All of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since we operate in many\n\ncountries, a percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and exchange volatility could positively or negatively impact those operating costs. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we may hold certain assets and liabilities, including potential tax liabilities, in local currency on our consolidated balance sheets. These tax liabilities would be settled in local currency. Therefore, foreign exchange gains and losses from remeasuring the tax liabilities are recorded to interest and other loss, net. We do not believe that foreign exchange volatility has a significant effect on our current business or results of operations. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business or results of operations in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nWe may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\n\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within operating expense, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating expenses could increase by approximately 2%.\n\n56\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 8.

            " can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2022 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including:\n\nDetailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business.\n\nOur EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity).\n\nDisability representation.\n\nPay equity (see details below).\n\nTotal Rewards and Pay Equity\n\nWe develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and is market competitive.\n\nIn order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base salaries of salaried employees would remain at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for rewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our practice of investing in stock for all rewards-eligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees.\n\n9\n\nPART I Item 1\n\nSince 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion report. In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men. In this year\u2019s report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce.\n\nIn addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce.\n\nOur intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.\n\nWellbeing and Hybrid Work\n\nMicrosoft is committed to supporting our employees\u2019 wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives. We have invested significantly in wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, disability accommodations, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working.\n\nWe introduced Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guidance to better support leaders, managers, and employees in hybrid work scenarios. Our ongoing survey data shows that 93% of employees value the flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and 78% are satisfied with the quality of connection with co-workers. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to flexible work at Microsoft. As a company, we will continue to leverage data and research to inform decision making, balancing the needs of business, team, and individual.\n\nLearning and Development\n\nWe offer a range of learning opportunities, including personalized opportunities on our internal and external learning portals, in-classroom learning, required learning on compliance and company culture, on-the-job advancement opportunities, and manager coaching. We also provide customized manager learning, new employee orientation, and tools for operating in a flexible hybrid work environment.\n\nAll Microsoft employees globally access our single Viva Learning tool for both required and personal choice learning.

Fiscal 2024 is a 53-week year.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments\n\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provisions for sales returns and allowances, inventory excess and obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, restructuring, income taxes, litigation and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. In the current macroeconomic environment, these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, these estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\nNote 2.

        "question": "How does inventory valuation impact COGS and gross margin with unexpected demand shifts?",
        "ground_truth": "If inventory is determined to be overvalued, costs would be recognized in the cost of goods sold (COGS) at the time of such determination. If inventory is undervalued, it may lead to over-reported COGS in previous periods, requiring recognition of additional gross margin when the related inventory is sold. Unanticipated changes in demand can significantly impact inventory value and results of operations.",
        "contexts": [
            " the future, if our inventory is determined to be overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Likewise, if our inventory is determined to be undervalued, we may have over-reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross margin at the time the related inventory is sold. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.\n\nAccounting for Income Taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our\n\nactual tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nWe recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current\n\nyear, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.\n\nEvaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all available positive and negative evidence,\n\nincluding recent earnings history and cumulative losses in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Using available evidence and judgment, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against U.S. federal and state research and development credits and certain acquired net operating losses and deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may significantly affect our tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs. Taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) inclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred.\n\nAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, the tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, the availability of tax incentives, tax credits and loss carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, which includes our estimates of the fair value of our intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings and tax audits. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of audits could be significantly different than the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a significant effect on our tax provision, results of operations, and cash flows. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could significantly affect our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.\n\n49\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if these positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in judgment regarding the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which the change occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with complex tax laws. We believe we have adequately provided for in our financial statements additional taxes that we estimate to be required to be paid as a result of such examinations. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Unpaid tax liabilities, including the interest and penalties, are released pursuant to a final settlement with tax authorities, completion of audit or expiration of various statutes of limitations. The significant jurisdictions in which we may be subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world include Germany, India, Israel, Singapore, and the United States.\n\nThe recognition and measurement"

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed",
            " in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cFCC Guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\n\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022.\n\nOther Contingencies\n\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $181 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\n\nNOTE 15 \u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nOn September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.

This share repurchase program commenced in November 2021, following completion of the program approved on September 18, 2019, has no expiration date, and may be terminated at any time. As of December 31, 2022, $31.5 billion remained of this $60.0 billion share repurchase program.\n\n24\n\nPART I Item 1\n\nWe repurchased the following shares of common stock under the share repurchase programs:\n\n(In millions)\n\nShares\n\nAmount\n\nShares\n\nFiscal Year First Quarter Second Quarter\n\n17 $ 20\n\n2023 4,600 4,600\n\n21 $ 20\n\nTotal\n\n37 $\n\n9,200\n\n41 $\n\nAll repurchases were made using cash resources.

        "ground_truth": "Macro factors and market swings can affect a company's stock and finances by causing fluctuations in stock price due to changes in quarterly results, revenue, or operating results being below estimates. Economic conditions such as recessions, inflation, and market volatility can impact customer demand, leading to order cancellations or reduced purchasing. These conditions can also result in higher inventory levels, excess capacity charges, and financial challenges for partners, affecting the company's ability to meet customer demands and collect revenue. Additionally, inflation and supply chain constraints can increase costs of components and commodities, affecting gross margins and financial results.",
        "contexts": [
            " our future performance. Due to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other factors, the price at which our common stock will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your common stock at or above the price you paid. In future periods, our stock price could decline if, among other factors, our revenue or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors. Our stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \u201cMRVL\u201d. As a result of stock price volatility, we may be subject to securities class action litigation. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business.\n\nCHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nWe face risks related to recessions, inflation, stagflation and other macroeconomic conditions.\n\nCustomer demand for our products may be impacted by weak macroeconomic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recessionary or lower-growth environments, rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions or reduce their use of our services. In addition, these economic conditions have resulted in the past, and could result in the future, in higher inventory levels and the resulting excess capacity charges from our manufacturing partners if we need to slow production to reduce inventory levels. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges and as a result they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customer demands or collect revenue or otherwise could harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our manufacturing partners, customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like, and our borrowing costs could increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions, or conditions in the semiconductor industry, or conditions in our customer end markets continue to deteriorate or experience a sustained period of weakness or slower growth, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n16\n\nIn addition, we are also subject to risk from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components, supplies, and commodity raw materials,\n\nwhich are incorporated into our end products or used by our manufacturing partners or suppliers to manufacture our end products.

            " IRS guidance in December of 2023, certain R&D costs were treated as subject to capitalization which resulted in utilization of R&D tax credits and a corresponding release of valuation allowances associated with those credits. As a result of the IRS guidance, as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we treated these R&D costs as currently deductible rather than subject to capitalization, which resulted in a reduction to our income tax payable and reinstatement of our deferred tax assets for R&D tax credits, and the corresponding full valuation allowance on such credits.\n\nOur provision for incomes taxes may be affected by changes in the geographic mix of earnings with different applicable tax rates, acquisitions, changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of income tax audits, the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations.\n\nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those assets become\n\ndeductible or creditable. We evaluate the recoverability of these assets, weighing all positive and negative evidence, and provide or maintain a valuation allowance for these assets if it is more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If negative evidence exists, sufficient positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. We consider all available evidence such as our earnings history including the existence of cumulative income or losses, reversals of taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In future periods, it is possible that significant positive or negative evidence could arise that results in a change in our judgment with respect to the need for a valuation allowance, which could result in a tax benefit, or adversely affect our income tax provision, in the period of such change in judgment.\n\nWe also continue to evaluate potential changes to our legal structure in response to guidelines and requirements in various international tax jurisdictions where we conduct business. Additionally, please see the information in Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under the caption \u201cChanges in existing taxation benefits, tax rules or tax practices may adversely affect our financial results.\u201d\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur principal source of liquidity as of August 3, 2024 consisted of approximately $808.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $580.5 million was held by subsidiaries outside of the United States, a portion of which are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States.\n\nAs of August 3, 2024, we had total borrowings outstanding of $4.2 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion of senior notes outstanding and $656.2 million\n\noutstanding under our 5-Year Tranche Loan (\u201c2026 Term Loan\u201d).\n\nDuring the three and six months ended August 3, 2024, we repaid $21.9 million and $43.8 million of the principal outstanding of the 2026 Term\n\nLoan.\n\nWe have a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of up to $1.0 billion and a 5-year term (\u201c2023 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of\n\nAugust 3, 2024, the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn and will be available for draw down through April 14, 2028.\n\nFor a description of our contractual obligations including debt and purchase commitments, see \u201cNote 4 \u2013 Debt,\u201d and \u201cNote 5 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see \u201cNote 9 \u2013 Income Tax\u201d regarding tax related contingencies and uncertain tax positions in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

During\n\nthe three and six months ended August 3, 2024, we generated cash from operations from the sale of certain trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a third-party financial institution pursuant to a factoring arrangement. See \u201cNote 11 \u2013 Supplemental Financial Information\u201d in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and funds from our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility\n\nwill be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, any declared dividends,",

Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in operating expenses, all of which are subject to uncertainty.\n\nTo the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated by operations, and funds available under our 2023 Revolving\n\nCredit Facility are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. We may also acquire additional businesses, purchase assets or enter into other strategic arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek debt or equity financing. Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock.\n\nFuture payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and our planned repurchases of common stock will be subject to, among\n\nother things, the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements, financial condition, developments in ongoing litigation, statutory requirements under Delaware law, U.S. securities laws and regulations, market conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

Cash inflow from working capital of $81.8 million for the six months ended August 3, 2024 was primarily driven by decreases in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, and inventories, and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and other non- current liabilities, and accrued employee compensation. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to decreased sales. The decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily driven by a decrease in prepaid ship and debits due to lower inventory balances at distributors, and a decrease in prepaid corporate income tax, partially offset by payments on supply capacity reservation agreements, net of refunds. The decrease in inventories was primarily due to an increase in demand and focused effort on supply chain efficiency as demand improves. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. The decrease in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities was primarily driven by lower ship and debit claims accrual due to lower inventory balances at distributors, partially offset by increases in income tax payable, interest accruals, and stock rotation accruals. The decrease in accrued employee compensation was due to bonus payout of our annual employee bonus plan.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended July 29, 2023 was $320.9 million. We had a net loss of $376.4 million adjusted for\n\nthe following non-cash items: amortization of acquired intangible assets of $541.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $296.0 million, deferred income tax benefit of $226.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $153.9 million, restructuring related impairment charges of $31.4 million, and $21.7 million of net loss from other non-cash items.

Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers as a result of the foregoing and other actions has caused, and may in the future cause, some of our customers in China to amass large inventories of our products well in advance of need or cause some of our customers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers. This can adversely affect accurately assessing our current and future demand for our products and our business.\n\nMost of our products are manufactured by third-party foundries located in Taiwan. In addition to restrictions imposed by the United States or China\n\non exports or imports from one another, we may be adversely impacted by export restrictions, labeling requirements or other trade related issues or disputes, or political conflicts or tensions between China and Taiwan as these restrictions and requirements could impact or delay the delivery of our products to our customers in China.\n\n28\n\nWe typically sell products to customers in China pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments. Some customers in China may be able to cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a penalty and, therefore, they may be more likely to do so while the tariffs and trade restrictions are in effect. See also, the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\u201d\n\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax, trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in U.S. or foreign international tax, social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business. For example, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including related export and other business sanctions on Russia) has not had a material impact on us due to our limited sales to Russia and Ukraine, we are unable to predict the indirect impact this conflict will have on us through impacts to the supply chain, the global and domestic economies, interest rates or stock markets. The U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that included the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on"

Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed.

The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.\n\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022.

Some customers in China may be able to cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a penalty and, therefore, they may be more likely to do so while the tariffs and trade restrictions are in effect. See also, the Risk Factor entitled \u201cWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.\u201d\n\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax, trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in U.S. or foreign international tax, social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business. For example, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including related export and other business sanctions on Russia) has not had a material impact on us due to our limited sales to Russia and Ukraine, we are unable to predict the indirect impact this conflict will have on us through impacts to the supply chain, the global and domestic economies, interest rates or stock markets. The U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that included the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. For example, on May 14, 2024, the Biden administration announced new tariffs on certain goods to encourage China to eliminate what the administration believes to be unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The administration is directing increases in tariffs on $18 billion of imports from China across certain strategic sectors including semiconductors. As a result, the tariff rate on semiconductors will increase from 25% to 50% by 2025. Any new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, adopted policies that discourage corporations from outsourcing manufacturing\n\nand production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which required us to change the way we conduct business. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting changes to trade, tax or other laws and policies may be disruptive to our businesses. These changes in U.S. and foreign laws and policies have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that included the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. For example, on May 14, 2024, the Biden administration announced new tariffs on certain goods to encourage China to eliminate unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The Biden administration directed increases in tariffs on a significant amount of imports from China across certain strategic sectors including semiconductors. As a result, the tariff rate on certain types of semiconductors increased from 25% to 50% in 2024. In addition, the Trump administration has recently announced new tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. These new tariffs are not expected to have a direct impact on the Company, however, any new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, adopted policies that discourage corporations from outsourcing manufacturing\n\nand production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which required us to change the way we conduct business. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting changes to trade, tax or other laws and policies may be disruptive to our businesses.

In addition, net revenue from our ten (10) largest customers, inclusive of our distributor and direct customers, represented 81% of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. Sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period and year to year and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with customers, the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets, adverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. or other governments (such as changes in export policies), and natural disasters or other issues. The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. For example, some of our large customers depend on rapid and continuous innovation and will select partners who can help them deliver innovation at their pace and if we are unable to deliver on these timelines we may miss significant business opportunities. To the extent one or more of our large customers experience financial challenges, bankruptcy or insolvency, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales and our ability to collect on receivables, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.

In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:\n\n\n\na significant portion of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which allows our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with relatively short notice to us;\n\n\n\ncustomers may purchase similar products from our competitors;\n\n\n\ncustomers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products;\n\n\n\ncustomers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions or tariffs, may develop their own solutions or acquire fully developed solutions from third parties; or\n\n\n\ncustomers may be subject to severe business disruptions, including, but not limited to, those driven by recessions, financial instability, actual or threatened public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other global or regional macroeconomic developments, or natural disasters.\n\nIn addition, there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations, including mergers,\n\nasset acquisitions and strategic partnerships (for example, Cisco acquired Acacia Communications in 2021). Mergers or restructuring among our customers, or their end customers, could increase our customer concentration with a particular customer or reduce total demand as the combined entities reevaluate their business and consolidate their suppliers. Such future developments, particularly in those end markets that account for more significant portions of our revenues, could harm our business and our results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we may be unable to negotiate as favorable terms with larger customers whether those customers resulted from customer consolidation,\n\nmerger integrations or other reasons, and any such less favorable terms could harm our business and our results of operations.\n\nGiven their dependence on semiconductor products"

If a peer company stops providing Non-GAAP EPS in a quarterly earnings report then it will be excluded from the Peer Group. The applicable performance period (the \u201cMultiplier Performance Period\u201d) for the Multiplier will be the 2-year period including the Company\u2019s fiscal years 2024 through 2025 and/or calendar year 2023 through 2024 for the companies in the Company\u2019s compensation peer group approved on February 16, 2022 (the \u201cPeer Group\u201d).

Such errors could result in:\n\n\n\nloss of or delay in market acceptance of our products;\n\nmaterial recall and replacement costs;\n\n\n\ndelay in revenue recognition or loss of revenue;\n\nwriting down the inventory of defective products;\n\n\n\nthe diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts;\n\n\n\nour having to defend against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury; and\n\n\n\ndamage to our reputation in the industry that could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\n\nIn addition, the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant\n\nresources. We may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field, which may cause us to incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and further reputational harm.

If we cannot retain or attract distributors or manufacturers\u2019 representatives, or if any of our distributors or manufacturer\u2019s representatives are unsuccessful in marketing and selling our products or terminate their relationships with us, our sales and results of operations will be harmed.\n\nWE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS\n\nAdverse changes in the political, regulatory and economic policies of governments in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business.\n\nRegulatory activity, such as tariffs, export controls and sanctions, economic sanctions, and related laws have in the past and may continue to materially limit our ability to make sales to customers in China, which has in the past and may continue to harm our results of operations, reputation and financial condition. Moreover, to the extent the governments of China, the United States or other countries seek to promote use of domestically produced products or to reduce the dependence upon or use of products from another (sometimes referred to as \u201cdecoupling\u201d), they may adopt or apply regulations or policies that have the effect of reducing business opportunities for us. Such actions may take the form of specific restrictions on particular customers, products, technology areas, or business combinations. For example, in the area of investments and mergers and acquisitions, the United States announced new requirements for approval by the United States government of outbound investments; and the approval by China regulatory authorities is required for business combinations of companies that conduct business in China over specific thresholds, regardless of where those businesses are based. Restrictions may also be imposed based on whether the supplier is considered unreliable or a security risk. For example, the Chinese government adopted a law that would restrict purchases from suppliers deemed to be \u201cunreliable suppliers\u201d. In May 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China banned the sale of Micron Technology, Inc.'s products to certain entities in China and stated that such products pose significant security risks to China's critical information infrastructure supply chain and national security.

If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.\n\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements, licenses and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, manufacturing or other business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Notwithstanding these agreements, we have experienced disputes with employees regarding ownership of intellectual property in the past.

Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\n\nReportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting.\n\nIn August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects these segment changes. Prior period segment information has",
            " been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business during fiscal year 2025.\n\nAdditional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 17 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).\n\n33\n\nPART I Item 2\n\nMetrics\n\nWe use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we made updates to our metrics in connection with the segment changes described above. These changes align our metrics with how we manage and monitor certain businesses. The key change was bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together and creating a new Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth metric. Other changes include combining Windows OEM and Devices into a single revenue growth metric that brings revenue from PC market-driven businesses together, as well as elevating our cloud revenue growth metrics to align to our strategic focus on cloud growth.\n\nCommercial\n\nOur commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise and partner services, and Dynamics products and cloud services. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.\n\nCommercial remaining performance obligation\n\nCommercial portion of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods\n\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue and revenue growth\n\nRevenue from Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, Azure and other cloud services, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365\n\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage\n\nGross margin percentage for our Microsoft Cloud business\n\nProductivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud\n\nMetrics related to our Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. The metrics primarily reflect growth across our cloud services.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth\n\nRevenue from Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, comprising Microsoft 365 Commercial, Enterprise Mobility + Security, the cloud portion of Windows Commercial, the per-user portion of Power BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot\n\nMicrosoft 365 Commercial seat growth\n\nThe number of Microsoft 365 Commercial seats at end of period where seats are paid users covered by a Microsoft 365 Commercial subscription\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue growth\n\nRevenue from Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions and other consumer services\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers\n\nThe number of Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers at end of period\n\nLinkedIn revenue growth\n\nRevenue from LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions\n\nDynamics 365 revenue growth\n\nRevenue from Dynamics 365, including a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power Automate\n\nAzure and other cloud services revenue growth\n\nRevenue from Azure and other cloud services, including cloud and AI consumption- based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings, and other cloud services\n\n34\n\nPART I Item 2\n\nMore Personal Computing\n\nMetrics related to our More Personal Computing segment assess the performance of our key consumer businesses.\n\nWindows OEM and Devices revenue growth\n\nRevenue from sales of Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel and sales of first-party Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories\n\nXbox content and services revenue growth\n\nRevenue from Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services\n\nSearch and news advertising revenue (ex TAC) growth\n\nRevenue from search and news advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs (\u201cTAC\u201d) paid to Bing Ads network publishers and news partners\n\nSUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)\n\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n\nPercentage\n\nChange\n\nSix Months Ended\n\nDecember 31,\n\nPercentage Change\n\nRevenue Gross margin Operating"

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2022\n\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments increased due to gains on equity securities in the current period compared to losses in the prior period.\n\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared with Nine Months Ended March 31, 2022\n\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities in the current period. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.\n\n42\n\nPART I Item 2\n\nINCOME TAXES\n\nEffective Tax Rate\n\nOur effective tax rate was 19% and 17% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 19% and 11% for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock- based compensation.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\n\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nWe settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in"
