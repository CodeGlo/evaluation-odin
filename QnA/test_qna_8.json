The SCL Protocol\n\n(2nd Edition, February 2017) mentions IAP as below:\n\n\u201cThe impacted as-planned analysis method involves introducing delay event sub-networks into\n\na logic-linked Baseline Programme and its recalculation using CPM programming software\n\nin order to determine the prospective impact these events have on the predicted contract\n\ncompletion dates shown within the baseline programme\u2026\u2026\u2026.

However, in this Application Contractor is updating its earlier EOT Application (i.e., EOT-11).\n\nTherefore, Contractor is using the Impacted Programme of EOT Application-11 (herein after\n\nreferred as \u2018Impacted Programme-0\u2019) as the base Programme for impacting the delay events of\n\nthis Application, to calculate the consolidate impact of all delay events since inception.\n\nImpacted As Planned (IAP) Delay Analysis Procedure\n\nPage 67 of 95\n\nInterim Request for Extension of Time\n\nDesign & Construction of Special Steel Bridges under Contract Package -15B (Across Narmada River)\n\n195.\n\nIn IAP, for analyzing the delay effect of each individual delay event, the baseline schedule is\n\ntaken (in this case as Impacted Programme-0 is taken), and the delay event is inserted into it.\n\nThen, the effect of that delay event(s) on scheduled completion date is analyzed with Impacted\n\nCompletion Date of the Project.

Typically, the application of an Impacted as Planned Baseline analysis adds one or more fragnet\n\n(a single or group of activities that describe the scope and duration of events which represent a\n\npotential delay) to the planned baseline schedule, to determine the cumulative effect on the\n\nschedule completion dates for key milestones and/ or overall completion of the Project.\n\nGraphical Representation of a typical IAP Method\n\n197.

The duration of the Contract has been extended due to several delay events beyond Contractor\u2019s control. Thus, Contractor will be deprived of the opportunity to make profits from any other project it would have taken up of the similar nature during the extended period.\n\n279. The Contractor\u2019s resources are tied up in this Contract in such a way that they would be neither be able to undertake any other Projects nor manage its existing projects as efficiently until the completion of this Services.\n\n280. The Contractor would have bagged new projects and generated additional revenues which in turn would have earned profits for the Contractor. Due to delays to the Time for Completion, the Contractor is obliged to complete this project and is not able to win new projects which would have brought profits to the Contractor\u2019s organization. Therefore, the Contractor is entitled for reimbursement of the loss of opportunity to make profits due to extension of Time for Completion.\n\n281. The Hudson Formula, covers both the \u2018loss of Overheads\u2019 and \u2018loss of Profit\u2019 on similar\n\ngrounds:\n\nFigure 9: Hudson Formula to calculate Loss of Profit\n\n282. This sets out a well-established basis of Claim for the Contractor because on account of the delays which were beyond Contractor\u2019s control, the Contractor could not take work on any other project and resulted in a loss of profit. The objective of this claim is to put the Contractor in the same financial position as it would have been, if such delays, that were not attributable to the Contractor, had not occurred.\n\n283. Based on the Extension of time submitted by the Contractor on 14 February 202441, the Contractor is entitled to claim prolongation cost for 3128 days till cut-off date of cost calculation i.e., 31 August 2024.\n\n284. The Contractor calculated the Loss of Profit on the basis of 1984 (4) Supreme Court case no 59 Judgement A.T Brij Paul Singh & others versus State of Gujarat and thus considered 15% as the loss of profit percentage for calculations.

The provision for price adjustment within the contract accounts for fluctuations in the cost of labor and materials.\n\n329. The first paragraph of Appendix-2, Page 1 of 9 of the Contract concerning price adjustment states: 'The Contract Price shall be subject to price adjustment during the contract's execution to reflect changes in the cost of labor, material components, etc., in accordance with the Contract Agreement.' The Contractor has submitted price variation invoices as escalation price invoices for supply, civil work, steel, and erection.

At the commencement of civil works, the Contractor was informed of an existing restriction imposed by local government authorities on the mining of sand and metal for construction purposes in and around the Solapur district. These restrictions were enforced through annual notifications issued by the District Authorities/Mining Department. As part of their regulatory framework, the authorities auctioned sand and metal mining rights annually, aiming to control and regulate resource exploitation.\n\n333. The auction process typically occurred between September and November, with tenders being finalized between October and December each year. Subsequently, mining rights were granted to successful bidders for a defined period, approximately six months, spanning February to September of the following year. It is critical to note that this significant site condition was neither disclosed in the Tender/NIT (Notice Inviting Tender) nor addressed during pre-bid meetings or post-bid discussions. Consequently, the Contractor remained unaware of these constraints and did not account for such",
            " contingencies in the bid price. The omission of this essential information significantly impacted the Contractor's ability to plan and budget for the works.\n\n335. Below are examples of official notifications issued by the authorities during the relevant years:\n\nS. No. 1 2 3\n\nNotification No.\n\nOffice/2/Goukh/RR/1935/14/Solapur Office/2/Goukh/RR/4014/Solapur Office/2/Goukh/RR/2931/Solapur\n\nDate of Notification\n\n22 December 2014 11 October 2015 25 October 2016\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 105 of 108\n\nCoal Handling Plant Package for Solapur Super Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW)\n\nDelay and Quantum Claim Report\n\n336. Although the above notifications are dated 2014, 2015, and 2016, similar restrictions and regulatory processes had been in place in preceding years, indicating a well-established limitation on resource availability for nearly half of each year.\n\nImpact on Project Execution:\n\n337. As a direct result of these mining restrictions, the Contractor was compelled to procure raw materials from distant locations outside the Solapur district. This necessitated incurring significant additional expenses for both the procurement of costlier materials and their transportation to the project site. These unforeseen costs and logistical challenges caused: a) A substantial increase in material costs, directly impacting project finances. b) Delays in material delivery, adversely affecting the progress of civil works. c) Overall disruption to the execution schedule, for which the Contractor bears no\n\nresponsibility.\n\n338. The resulting challenges not only increased the project costs but also impeded timely execution, thereby creating a cascading impact on the Contractor's obligations and performance under the Contract.\n\n339. Following are the details of additional Cost incurred by the Contractor due to these mining restriction in procuring Sand and Aggregate at a higher price in view of timely completion of the Project.\n\nS No\n\n1\n\n2\n\nMaterial used in civil Works & Quantity (in\n\nGovt Rate per Brass\n\nBrass)\n\nSand-2908 brass Aggregate-5637 brass\n\n800\n\n400\n\nTotal Amount actual as per Govt Rate (INR)\n\n2,326,400\n\n2,254,800\n\nRate at which material was procured far away from the Solapur during Execution Stage (2014 to 2016) 2,650\n\n3,500\n\nTotal Amount as per Escalated Purchase Rate (INR)\n\n7,706,200\n\n19,729,500\n\nDifferential Amount Claimable (INR)\n\n5,379,800\n\n17,474,700\n\nTOTAL\n\n22,854,500\n\n340.

The events outlined in Part 4 herein above are the delay events that prevented the Contractor from fulfilling its obligations as per the Contract. It is to be noted that all such delay events that have occurred in the Project from 09 April 2012 till 31 January 2024 (Cut-off date) have been considered. The delays that may occur / have occurred after 31 January 2024 would have further implication on the entitlement of Extension of Time for Completion under Clause 40.1 of the Contract Agreement which would be assessed at later stage during the tenure of the Project. In this report distinct cutoff dates have been considered for the cost calculations to ensure accurate and contractually compliant evaluations. The interim cut-off date of 31 January 2024 focuses on the specific interim timeframe during which the delays occurred, aligning with the submission of request for Extension of Time by the Contractor (i.e., on 16 February 202450) and contractual obligations for performance. Conversely, the cost calculations i.e., only the head office overheads, loss of profit, and bank guarantee charges, are based on a different cutoff date (i.e., 31 August 2024), as these costs extend beyond the interim delay period and are influenced by ongoing financial impacts on the Contractor. The interest incurred on these cost claims has been calculated till 31 August 2024. This approach ensures a comprehensive and equitable assessment. By differentiating the cutoff dates, the report accurately captures both the temporal scope of the delays and the broader financial implications.\n\n343. Additionally, other"

Consequently, the commencement and completion of the civil and structural works were delayed by a period ranging from 12 to 24 months, leading to a substantial increase in the Contractor's costs.\n\niii. Cause & Effect Analysis\n\n144. The Contractor contends that the Mechanical GAD for Conveyor Gallery 6A/6B was designed and approved under Category III. However, during a meeting on 27 November 2013, the Employer instructed the Contractor to modify the cable gallery to avoid interference with the trestle of Conveyor 6A/6B. Despite the Contractor's cooperation and timely revisions, finalized on 16 and 17 December 2013 and approved on 03 January 2014, the Employer's delay in providing key load details and identifying obstructions resulted in an overall delay of 12 to 24 months. These unforeseen delays significantly impacted the Contractor's timeline and costs, warranting a justifiable claim for extension of time and additional compensation as per the Contract.\n\n145.

            ". It is essential to note that the excavation work, critical to the Project\u2019s progress, was already hindered by design finalization issues, which were further exacerbated by the Employer\u2019s delayed coordination with the state authorities. Consequently, the Contractor bears no responsibility for the delays caused by the Employer\u2019s inefficiencies in securing the blasting approval. i. Contractual Entitlement\n\n163. Clause 10.3 of the CA\n\n\u201cThe Employer shall acquire and pay for all permits, approvals and/or licenses from all local, state or national government authorities or public service undertakings in the country where the Site is located, which such authorities or undertakings require the Employer to obtain in the Employer\u2019s name for the execution of the Contract (they include those required for the performance by both the Contractor and the Employer of their respective obligations under the Contract), including those specified in Appendix 6 (Scope of Works and Supply by the Employer) to the Contract Agreement.\u201d\n\n164. Clause 10.4 of the CA\n\n\u201cIf requested by the Contractor, the Employer shall use its best endeavors to assist the Contractor in obtaining in a timely and expeditious manner all permits, approvals and/or licenses necessary for the execution of the Contract from all local, state or national government authorities or public service undertakings that such authorities or undertakings require the Contractor or Subcontractors or the personnel of the Contractor or Subcontractors, as the case may be, to obtain.\u201d\n\nii. Chronology of Events\n\n165. The Contractor wishes to assert that at the commencement of civil works, it was notified that there is a local government-imposed restriction of six months per year on the mining of sand and metal in and around Solapur.\n\n166. This process involves notifications issued by the district authorities for the auctioning of mining rights for sand and metal for a restricted period of six (06) months. The auctioning process occurs from September to October each year, followed by the finalization of\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 47 of 108\n\nCoal Handling Plant Package for Solapur Super Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW)\n\nDelay and Quantum Claim Report\n\ntenders by the Mining Department from October to December, culminating in the award of mining rights to successful bidders for approximately six (06) months, from February to September each year.\n\n167. The table below provides references to notifications detailing the six (06) month annual restriction on mining activities for the years 2014 to 2016. It is important to note that this practice was consistently followed in previous years as well.\n\nS.NO. 1 2 3\n\nNOTIFICATION NO.& DATE\n\nOffice/2/Guokh/RR/1935/14/Solapur dated 22 December 2014 Office/2/Guokh/RR/4014/Solapur dated 11 October 2015 Office/2/Guokh/RR/2931/Solapur dated 25 October 2016\n\n168. The Contractor, referencing the above contention, emphasizes that during the auctioning and finalization process, it was compelled to procure sand and metal from distant locations to the worksite. Furthermore, the Contractor underscores that the restriction on mining sand and metal was neither specified in the tender documents nor communicated to the Contractor during the Contract finalization.\n\n169. Consequently, the Contractor incurred increased material procurement costs and experienced delayed material deliveries due to extended travel distances. This significantly hindered the execution of civil works, causing delays not attributable to the Contractor.\n\niii. Cause & Effect Analysis\n\n170. The Contractor's claim highlights that at the commencement of civil works, a six-month local government-imposed restriction on sand and metal mining around Solapur was not disclosed in the tender documents or during contract finalization. This restriction, enforced through a formal auctioning and tendering process from September to December, limited the availability of local materials from February to September. As a result, the Contractor was compelled to procure materials from distant locations, incurring additional costs and material delivery delays. These unforeseen circumstances, beyond the Contractor's control, significantly impacted the timely execution of civil works, justifying the delays claimed.

This Delay Analysis is performed to analyze the details of the multiple delay events, disruptions\n\nand Variations that occurred to the Project during the execution, by establishing the Cause and\n\nEffect relationships of the events and finally, assessing the impact of the events on the\n\ncompletion of the Project.\n\n182.\n\nIn this submission, the exercise of delay analysis is performed according to the principles set out in the Society of Construction Law (SCL) Delay protocol 2nd Edition 2017.\n\n183. The delay analysis is performed on Primavera software using the Sub-clause 8.3 Programme\n\nexchanged between the Parties during the execution of the Project.\n\nBackground\n\n184. The Contractor, in its various delay notifications and Extension of Time applications, intimated\n\nthe Engineer from time to time of major delay & disruption events that occurred during the\n\nexecution of the Project beyond the Contractor\u2019s control, which led to delay in achieving\n\nProject Milestones as per set timelines. This delay analysis exercise attempts to interrogate the\n\n\u2018time\u2019 implications of the major delay events as listed and explained in Part- 6 of this\n\nsubmission.\n\n185.\n\nIn this submission, the delay analysis is performed based on the Critical Path Method (CPM)\n\nwhich determines the Contractor\u2019s EOT entitlement (Excusable Delay) for the delay events not\n\nattributable to the Contractor.\n\n186. The delay analysis is performed to analyze the multiple delay events and disruptions that\n\noccurred to the Project, from the commencement of the Project (i.e., 15 October 2015) to the\n\ncut-off date (i.e., 25 August 2022).\n\n187. The advantage of performing analysis with a software is that the critical path (which is the\n\ndefined duration of the Project) is defined by the software itself.\n\nPage 65 of 95\n\nInterim Request for Extension of Time\n\nDesign & Construction of Special Steel Bridges under Contract Package -15B (Across Narmada River)\n\nSelection of suitable delay analysis methodology\n\n188. The Contract does not nominate any specific delay analysis methodology to be undertaken for\n\nassessing the Contractor\u2019s EOT entitlement.\n\n189. There are many standard methodologies which are currently prevalent for performing a Delay\n\nAnalysis, but each one has its own advantages as well as its limitations. Therefore, the selection\n\nof a suitable methodology is made, depending upon the various factors i.e., agreement\n\nconditions, Project complexity, Project status, availability of Programme, records and other\n\ngoverning factors.\n\n190.

The Contractor, after extensive discussions and incorporating the Employer's comments as of 05 August 2013, submitted the Civil General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) to the Employer on 07 September 2013. The Employer approved the submission on 05 October 2013, under Category II.\n\n102. Upon receiving approval of the Civil GAD from the Employer on 05 October 2013, the Contractor promptly commenced the works. During the excavation of the TP-5 foundation, it was discovered that RCC drains interfered with two footings of TP-5, which had not been accounted for by the Employer in its plot plan. By this time, all relevant drawings (civil/mechanical) had already been approved under Category I. Consequently, the Contractor formally requested the Employer to re-route or remove the drains to proceed with the civil works of TP-5. However, the Employer failed to provide decision on the aforementioned issue for approximately 4 months.\n\n103. As a result of this delay, the Contractor sought a meeting with the Executive Director (Engineering) on 27 November 201321 (as documented in the Minutes of Meeting dated 27 November 2013). During this meeting, the Employer advised the Contractor to dismantle the drain. Although dismantling the drain was not within the Contractor's scope, the Contractor agreed to do so in the interest of the project. Subsequently, the civil works were undertaken by the Contractor after dismantling the drain.\n\n104. Due to this delay and the execution of additional works beyond the Contractor's scope, the commencement of work at the site was postponed until January 2014, resulting in an approximately four-month delay solely attributable to the Employer.\n\niii. Cause & Effect Analysis\n\n105. The Contractor fulfilled its obligations by submitting the Civil General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) to the Employer on 07 September 2013, and despite the Employer's approval on 05 October 2013, unforeseen obstructions caused by RCC drains, unaccounted for in the Employer plot plan, delayed the works. The Employer\u2019s failure to promptly resolve this issue, despite the Contractor\u2019s formal request and subsequent meetings with the Executive Director on 27 November 2013, resulted in further delays. Although dismantling the drain was beyond the Contractor's contractual scope, the Contractor agreed to perform",

However, during formal discussions on 18 July 2012, M/s BGR/NTPC directed the Contractor to modify the Tipper finished floor level from 59.4 meters to 54.4 meters, as recorded in the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) dated 18 July 2012, and 07 September 2012. Consequently, the top floor level of the Conveyor Drives/TPs, starting from TP2, was required to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 29 of 108\n\nCoal Handling Plant Package for Solapur Super Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW)\n\nDelay and Quantum Claim Report\n\n76. This delayed instruction from the Employer regarding changes in the Tripper floor level, which occurred after a period exceeding 3.5 years, significantly delayed the design of the civil and structural work and the associated galleries, including all TPs, by nearly six (6) months. Consequently, the execution of civil works, including excavation and civil and structural works for TPs and galleries, was also delayed. It is crucial to highlight that despite the adjustments to lower the bunker and the top tripper floor levels of TPs, the Employer did not permit the Contractor to reduce the roof levels of TPs. This was contrary to the clear provision stating, \"the Conveyor profile shall be finalized during detailed engineering, considering all facilities\" as per the minutes of the meeting dated 23 January 2012 to 27 January 2012, during the pre-award stage, which forms part of the Contract. This statement indicates that the levels and ratings were to be finalized based on the actual engineering requirements of the system. The Employer's rejection to allow these changes further delayed the design and engineering of TPs, particularly",
            " TP-5.\n\n78. As a result of these delays, the commencement and completion of Civil Works and subsequent tasks could only proceed upon the finalization of the mechanical General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) and Civil GAD i.e., after 05 October 2013.\n\niii.

DE 01.3: Delay in Finalisation of TP-5\n\ni. Chronology of Events\n\n80. On 17 May 2012, the Contractor submitted the mechanical designs for TP-6, TP-7, TP-8, and TP-9 to the Employer, in accordance with the tender drawings. The Employer, however, failed to provide any feedback on the Contractor\u2019s submission by 18 July 2012.\n\n81. On 18 July 2012, a meeting was held between the Employer and the Contractor, during which the Contractor received new Bunker level (54.5 meters) and Tripper Floor level from the Employer. Consequently, the Contractor was required to revise the designs for all the TP\u2019s (specifically TP-6, TP-7, TP-8, and TP-9) and subsequently submitted the revised designs to the Employer on 30 November 2012, for TP-6 and TP-7, and on 07 January 2013, for TP-8 and TP-9, due to delays attributable to the Employer. Prior to receiving instructions from the Employer on 18 July 2012, the Contractor had completed all design-related work for the mechanical General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) of TP-5. However, given the new Bunker and Tripper Floor levels provided by the Employer on 18 July 2012, the Contractor had to redesign the Mechanical GAD for TP-5. As a result of these changes, the Contractor submitted the revised mechanical GAD to the\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 30 of 108\n\nCoal Handling Plant Package for Solapur Super Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW)\n\nDelay and Quantum Claim Report\n\nEmployer on 28 August 2012, which was subsequently approved under Category II on 05 August 2013, nearly a year later.\n\n83. Due to the revised Bunker and Tripper Floor levels per the Employer's instructions, it was mandatory to adjust the level of Conveyor 5A and 5B relative to the new Bunker and Tripper Floor levels. The Employer, however, insisted and instructed the Contractor to maintain the original Tripper Floor Level for Conveyor 5A and 5B, disregarding the revised Bunker and Tripper Floor levels of 54.5 meters set by the Employer on 18 July 2012.\n\n84. The Contractor continuously pleaded that keeping Conveyor 5A and 5B at the original levels would result in excessively long chute lengths, causing coal transported by these conveyors to fall from a higher vertical height onto Conveyor 6A and 6B, whose height had already been lowered. This significant height difference could lead to substantial equipment damage and excessive wear and tear on Conveyor 6A and 6B, due to coal falling from a greater height. Such a design is neither desirable nor consistent with good engineering practices. Accordingly, the Contractor highlights a provision from the minutes of the meeting held from 23 January 2012 to 27 January 2012 which clearly states that all parameters and ratings designs would be finalized based on actual engineering requirements. Following extensive discussions and clarifications, the Employer finally agreed to lower the height of Conveyor 5A and 5B to mitigate the impact of coal falling from a higher vertical height onto Conveyor 6A and 6B. This process of finalizing the levels for Conveyor 5A and 5B caused significant delays in the Mechanical and Civil GAD for TP-5, with no fault attributable to the Contractor. In an effort to mitigate the Employer's delays, the Contractor, even without awaiting approval of the Mechanical GAD from the Employer, submitted the Structural GAD on 22 July 2013. The Employer approved the Mechanical GAD for TP-5 under Category",
            " II on 05August 2013, delaying the mechanical GAD for TP- 5 by 12 months. The Structural GAD for TP-5 was approved by the Employer on 13 August 2013. Consequently, these delays severely impacted the submission of the Civil GAD for TP-5, which the Contractor was only able to submit to the Employer on 07 September 2013. The Employer subsequently approved the Civil GAD under Category II on 05 October 2013, allowing structural fabrication and civil work at the site to commence post 05 October 2013.\n\nii. Cause & Effect Analysis\n\n86. The Employer's failure to provide timely feedback on the Contractor's design submissions and instructions to revise Bunker and Tripper Floor levels on 18 July 2012 caused significant delays.

The Contractor asserts that during the post-bid discussions between the Employer and the Contractor, as documented in the minutes of the meeting dated 23 January 2012 to 27 January 2012, it was mutually agreed that the conveyor profile and the motor ratings would be finalized during detailed engineering based on the final layout.\n\n88. However, while approving the documents, the Employer insisted that the motor ratings (in kW) shall align to the respective ratings indicated in the Indure\u2019s bid data for the CHP package. Consequently, due to the Project's nature and the longstanding relationship with the Employer, the Contractor was compelled to agree to the Employer\u2019s demand to supply motors with higher ratings, even though these were not required per the original specifications as well as the Contract.\n\n89. As a result of this demand, the Contractor had to resubmit the designs on to align with the revised motor ratings mandated by the Employer. This caused a substantial delay in the design submission and approval process for a period of approximately 5 months18 from the date of 1st submission of ratings i.e., 31 July 2012. Consequently, the supply timeline was severely impacted, as the Contractor received approval for the design specifications from the Employer only on 26 March 2013. This delay meant that the Contractor could place orders for the motors as per the Employer\u2019s demanded specifications only after March 2013. ii. Cause & Effect Analysis\n\n90. The Contractor contends that, based on the minutes of meetings held from 23 January 2012 to 27 January 2012, it was agreed during post-bid discussions that the conveyor profile and motor ratings would be finalized during detailed engineering. However, the Employer later insisted that the motor ratings align with Indure\u2019s bid data, which was not in accordance with the Contract or the original specifications. Despite this, the Contractor, under pressure due to the Project\u2019s nature and its relationship with the Employer, complied.\n\n91. This led to a redesign and resubmission of documents, resulting in a 5-month delay from 31 July 2012, and supply orders could only be placed after receiving final approval on 26 March 2013. The delay significantly impacted the project timeline, further affecting the supply schedule. DE 01.5: Delay in timely approval of Conveyor Drives\n\n91.

The Contractor, in full compliance with the Employer's technical specifications, selected the gearbox for the conveyor drives. After verifying conformity with the recommended practices of the selected manufacturers, the Contractor submitted the design and drawings to the Employer for approval. Despite the submitted drawings meeting all required technical and contractual parameters, the Employer delayed their approval by six months.

Chronology of Events\n\n68. The Contractor would like to highlight that in accordance with the L2 Schedule submitted to the Client on 02 May 201215, the Contractor commenced Basic & Detailed Engineering for Wagon Tipplers and submitted preliminary designs to the Employer based on the Tender drawings. However, to finalize the design, critical details such as the final Rail Track layout of the Wagon Tippler complex area and the location/coordinates of the Wagon Tippler were required from the Employer to complete the GAD and initiate civil excavation and civil designs. Consequently, the Contractor made several requests to the Employer on 15 June 201216 and 20 August 201217 to provide these details to ensure timely completion as per the schedule.\n\n69. Despite these requests, the Employer failed to provide a satisfactory response regarding the coordinates of the Wagon Tippler and the Rail Track layout for over six months. Following repeated requests and follow-ups, the Employer eventually provided the relevant details, including the Rail Track layout and location coordinates of the Wagon Tippler area, via email on 5 October 2012. This significant delay in providing the necessary inputs caused a delay of over six months in subsequent activities such as designing, ordering, supply, and execution at the site, including civil works and erection.\n\n70. Along with the required details, the Employer also provided major comments on the preliminary design submitted by the Contractor. As a result, the Contractor had to redesign the General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) of the Wagon Tippler and conveyor 2A/2B, along with other related equipment and civil/structural designs and drawings.\n\n71. This also delayed the ordering of the Side Arm Charger and other related equipment for the Wagon Tippler complex, leading to significant delays in the submission of designs and drawings, civil works, and material supply.\n\n72. After receiving the Employer's comments on 05 October 2012, the Contractor was in a position to submit the Mechanical GAD of the Wagon Tippler complex, including TP-1 & Tunnels, by 21 November 2012. The Employer approved this submission on 6 December 2012 in Category-II. Following this approval, the Contractor submitted the Civil GAD for the same on 05 January 2013, which was approved on 21 January 2013 in Category-II. Consequently, due to the Employer's"

Chronology of Events\n\n207. Clause 5.1 of Appendix\u2013I to the Contract Agreement under the sub-heading \u201cMode of Payment,\u201d which forms an integral part of the contract, explicitly stipulates the obligation for the Employer to establish a Letter of Credit (LC) for dispatch payments on a quarterly basis, in accordance with the cash flow projections submitted by the Contractor. The relevant provision is quoted below for ease of reference: \u201cThe Employer will establish an irrevocable Letter of Credit (L/C) in favour of the Contractor through the Employer\u2019s Bank in the Employer\u2019s country for payments due, as per Terms of Payment, on dispatch of equipment, i.e., Ex-works/CIF dispatch of equipment (including due payments towards ocean freight and marine insurance).\u201d\n\n208. Pursuant to this contractual requirement, the first cash flow for the establishment of the LC was duly submitted by the Contractor on 02 March 201332. Despite repeated requests and consistent follow-up, the LC was not established by the Employer. Subsequently, we were informed by NTPC that, due to their inability to open the LC, dispatch payments would instead be made directly, with assurances of prompt release.\n\n209. However, contrary to these assurances, every payment was significantly delayed by a period ranging from 25 to 50 days, largely attributable to the extended time taken\u2014at least 10 days\u2014for the transit and processing of bills sent to Solapur. Conversely, had the LC been established at our bank as per the contractual provision, payments would have been processed and disbursed within a period of 3 days, thereby avoiding unnecessary delays.\n\n210. Additionally, payments for other service-related bills were also subject to substantial\n\ndelays.\n\n211. The failure to establish the LC for dispatch payments, despite persistent requests and follow-up, constitutes a breach of the Employer\u2019s contractual obligations. This non- compliance directly contributed to delays in payment processing and subsequently disrupted the supply and execution timelines of the contract. These delays have had a cascading effect on the overall progress of the project, further aggravating the situation and impeding the fulfilment of the contractual objectives. iii.

Chronology of Events\n\n217. The delivery of supplies was required to align with the release of fronts and the unit commissioning schedule to prevent the premature expiry of warranties and guarantees, as well as to avoid damages or deterioration of materials. Accordingly, wherever feasible, the supplies were to be deferred. In the interim, the Government of India implemented the Goods and Services Tax (GST) with effect from 01 July 2017. Consequently, the exemptions on taxes and duties applicable to the Lara Project, categorized as a Mega Power Project, were withdrawn. For imported materials, the exemption remained applicable only to customs duty, while Integrated GST (IGST) at 18% of the CIF value was levied on all imported materials. Additionally, full GST payments were mandated on all indigenous supplies, with GST rates ranging from 18% to 28%. Subsequently, these rates were reduced to 18% for most items.\n\n219. M/s NTPC made a decision on 06 November 2017 to partially reimburse GST at a rate of 14.5% against the levied GST rates of 28% or 18%. However, from this reimbursement, a 5% deduction was made towards input tax credit, which was inapplicable, as all input tax credits were available under the earlier tax regime. As a result, the effective reimbursement was limited to 9.5% against the actual GST levy of 28% or 18%. The implementation of this decision was delayed by an additional 1\u20132 months due to the finalization of invoice formats and other formalities. Consequently, the reimbursement decision took nearly 8 months to implement and was initially applicable for a mere 3-month period, up to March 2018. Later, in June 2018, this period was extended until January 2019, just two months prior to the proposed COD of the units.\n\n220. Despite our repeated submissions, the payment of GST was further deferred. Ultimately, the GST reimbursement was agreed upon only after 21 months, i.e., on 15 April 2020. However, the actual payment has not yet been received, and full GST reimbursement remains unadmitted and unpaid to date.\n\n221. We have consistently apprised M/s NTPC that the implementation of GST represented a comprehensive overhaul of the country\u2019s indirect tax structure. The Constitution was amended to delete existing provisions related to indirect taxes, replacing them with new provisions for GST. Thus, GST cannot be treated as a mere amendment to the tax laws; instead, it fundamentally altered the legal framework. The contractual provisions governing indirect taxes under the pre-GST regime have become redundant. Consequently, either the contract stands void to the extent of the tax-related provisions, or these provisions must be amended to incorporate GST payments, ensuring the contract remains valid and equitable for both parties.\n\n222. Additionally, the delayed and partial payment of GST constitutes unjust enrichment on the part of NTPC. GST has been incorporated as a capital cost for tariff determination; however, its payment has been inordinately delayed, and full payment has not been made. This has allowed NT"

The IGST on the import of goods was levied under the Customs Act, 1962, read with the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. Due to this structural change in the country\u2019s tax regime, materials previously exempt from custom duties and taxes became subject to IGST. This change impacted the tax-exempt status of the imported components for the project. In light of the above, soon after the implementation of GST in July 2017, the issue of IGST payment on imported components arose. The Contractor therefore submits this claim for the reimbursement of IGST paid on the imported components, as mandated by the revised tax structure.\n\n314.

            "\nIn this methodology, the critical path of the Project is determined after inserting the Employer\u2019s delay and disruption events that determines the Contractor\u2019s EOT entitlement (Excusable Delay) for the delay events not attributable to the Contractor.\n\n5.3\n\nTECHNICAL BACKGROUND: CPM\n\n233.\n\nIn this report, the delay analysis is performed based on the Critical Path Method (CPM). The CPM is a methodology or management technique that determines a Project's critical path, which is the sequence of Project network activities (from start to finish), the sum of whose durations determines the overall Project duration. There may be more than one critical path depending on workflow logic.\n\n5.4\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL DELAY EVENTS\n\n234. To make a realistic assessment of the delays that result in prolongation of the Project period, the following approach was adopted in the delay analysis for the identification of the delay events.\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 65 of 108\n\nCoal Handling Plant Package for Solapur Super Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW)\n\nDelay and Quantum Claim Report\n\ni. As per the CPM (Critical Path Method), out of many activities in the Project, there are only a few activities (or paths) that are Critical; meaning any delay in the Critical Path activity will delay the overall completion of the Project.\n\nii.\n\nSimilarly, delay occurring to Near-critical activities doesn\u2019t affect the completion of the Project, but these activities still have importance in delay analysis as these activities run concurrent to Critical activities, and the criticality of the path may be altered under changed circumstances.\n\nIdentification of Critical Activities\n\nInserting the Delay into Baseline/ Updated Schedule\n\nAnalysing the effect on Project Milestones and Completion Date\n\niii. Now, it is to observe and analyse; how the completion of the entire Project is affected when any Critical or Near-critical Activity is delayed. The delays (which actually occurred or potentially occur) are inserted into Critical Path and its effect is calculated cumulatively.\n\n5.5\n\nSELECTION OF SUITABLE DELAY ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY\n\n235. The method of delay analysis is not specified under the Contract. Therefore, in absence of express provision under the Contract regarding the use of delay analysis technique, and keeping in cognizance that the Project is ongoing, the Contractor is of the opinion that the Impacted As-Planned Analysis is the most appropriate method of delay analysis for this case.\n\n236. This methodology requires certain conditions to be fulfilled in order to perform a delay\n\nanalysis. Such conditions are fulfilled in this case:\n\nLogic linked baseline programme, which is available in this case \u2022 A selection of delay events to be modelled; this has been done in this analysis\n\n237. Clause 11.6 (a) of the SCL protocol 2nd Edition describes that the impacted as-planned analysis method involves introducing delay event sub-networks into a logic-linked baseline programme and its recalculation using CPM programming software in order to determine the prospective impact these events have on the predicted contract completion dates shown within the baseline programme. Before embarking upon the analysis, the analyst needs to confirm that the sequences and durations for the works shown in the programme are reasonable, realistic and achievable and properly logically linked within the software, to deal with the risk that the baseline programme contains fundamental flaws which cannot be overcome.\n\nPrivileged and Confidential\n\nPage 66 of 108\n\nCoal Handling Plant Package for Solapur Super Thermal Power Project (2x660 MW)\n\nDelay and Quantum Claim Report\n\n5.6\n\nIMPACTED-AS-PLANNED DELAY ANALYSIS PROCEDURE\n\n238.\n\nIn IAP, for analyzing the delay effect of each individual delay event, the Baseline Schedule is taken, and the delay event is inserted into it. Then, the effect of that delay event(s) on Scheduled Completion Date is analyzed with Impacted Completion Date of the Project. This methodology is called as Impacted as Planned (IAP) methodology.\n\n239. Baseline Program Establishment:\n\nThe initial step in the IAP methodology is the establishment of an accurate and accepted baseline program. The baseline program serves as the original schedule against which the impacts of delays are measured. It must reflect the contractor\u2019s planned sequence of work and be approved by all relevant parties.\n\n240.\n\nIdentification of Delay Events:\n\nAll potential delay events must be meticulously identified and documented. These events also include variations, site conditions, inclement weather, and other unforeseen circumstances that may affect the project's progress.\n\n241.\n\nInsertion of Delay Events:\n\nThe identified delay events are then sequ"
