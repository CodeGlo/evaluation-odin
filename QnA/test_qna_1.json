            "-and-go operations, weather delays, or from discrete periods of added work or suspensions. In addition, extended durations may be due to experiencing lower labor productivity than planned for when the activity duration was developed. Unless the delay is fully attributable to a discretely identifiable period of exclusive extra work performance, quantification of this type of delay requires some estimating on the part of the analyst.\n\nb. Distinguishing ALV from Project-Level Variance (PLV)\n\nThe ALV should be distinguished from the project-level variance (PLV) which is also a variance but at the overall project level. While the ALVs occur close in time to the causes, i.e. in the same period, the PLV may be months apart from the actual cause(s of the delay PLV is the result of the aggregation of ALV\u201fs after taking into account network float. Within the context of this RP, ALVs are considered \u201edelays\u201f regardless of the amount of float they carry. The activity experiences a delay if an ALV exists regardless if the delay affects the project completion date, i.e. the PLV.\n\nc. Distinguishing Delay-Cause from Delay-Effect\n\nIt is important for the analyst to be able to distinguish the cause of delay from the resulting effect. For example, a fully updated schedule may show extended activities and delayed start of activities relative to their controlling predecessors. While the cause may not be apparent, a competent statusing of the schedule will show the delay-effects. What caused the initial ALV for the chain of activities often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. If, on the other hand, a delay was appropriately inserted into the schedule as a new activity as a predecessor to the activity\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n34 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nwith the start delay, the cause of the ALV is readily apparent.\n\nThe identification of delay-causes is a focus in the latter phases of delay analysis, during causation analysis.\n\nd. Delay Characterization is Independent of Responsibility\n\nALV\u201fs are considered \u201cdelays\u201d independent of the responsibility for those variances. Thus an ALV can be contractor-caused or owner-caused, but it is still a delay. Similarly, the characterization of delays as \u201eexcusable\u201f, \u201ecompensable\u201f, \u201econcurrent\u201f and \u201epaced\u201f are attributes that are assigned well after the initial delay analysis starts by examining ALVs based on the causation analysis that has been performed after the schedule analysis is completed.\n\n2. Identifying and Collecting Delays\n\na. Two Main Approaches to Identification and Collection\n\ni. Cause-Based Approach\n\nThis approach starts with the collection of suspected causes of delays and then determining the effect they had on the baseline schedule and individual schedule updates. It is a \u201ecauses in search of effects\u201f approach. This is often used in the additive modeling methods. For example, an analysis may review the monthly reports, searching for issues that may have caused delays to the project.\n\nii. Effect-Based Approach\n\nThis approach is the opposite of the cause-based approach. It starts by compiling a set of ALV\u201fs and then identifies the causes of those variances. Specific documents that are associated with the time-frame, activity description, and amount of ALV\u201fs are reviewed to see if they could have created this variance. This approach is applied in the observational and the subtractive modeling methods. In the majority of the analysis scenarios, the effect-based approach is the more economical approach.\n\nb. Criticality of the Delay\n\nIt is important for an analyst to not prejudge criticality, nor limit the collection process to only those delays perceived to affect the critical path, especially if the delays are being identified for a modeled method. In addition, a path that is near critical in one window maybe become critical in the next especially if delays are being extracted from the critical path. For example, in the Modeled / Subtractive / Single Simulation (MIP 3.8) and the Modeled / Subtractive / Multiple Base (MIP 3.9) methods, as delays are being stripped from the critical path, the path will \u201ccollapse\u201d and the first near critical path will become critical. This is an iterative method and therefore, paths may collapse numerous times so that a path that originally has plenty of float becomes the critical path. The ultimate critical path quantification from the effect of each delay will eventually be determined in the modeling process. It is impossible for the analyst to know what the final critical path is until all of these delays have been added in (MIP"

            " the past updates16, the trend indicates that it would become near- critical in the next period. Therefore, it should be considered near-critical even though it carries more relative float than the duration of the interval.\n\n4. Amount of Time or Work Remaining on the Project\n\nAs the project approaches completion, CPM may not be the best tool to assess criticality. This is true especially in a problem project where many activities are being performed out-of-sequence in an attempt to meet an aggressive deadline. Even on a normal project, as the work transitions from final finishes to punch list work, CPM updates may be abandoned in favor of a list or matrix format of work scheduling. It is often said that near the end \u201eeverything is critical\u201f.\n\nReduced to an equation, the percentage of activities remaining on the network that should be considered near-critical is proportional to the degree of completion of the schedule.\n\nTherefore, after 90 to 95 percent of the base scope and change order work are complete, the analyst may want to consider all activities on the schedule as near-critical regardless of float.\n\nC. Identifying the As-Built Critical Path\n\nIt is impossible to accurately determine the as-built critical path by using only conventional float calculation on the past portion (left) of the data date. Because of this technical reason, the critical set of as-built activities is often called the controlling activities as opposed to critical activities.\n\nOne method to show the as-built critical path is to create a collapsible as-built CPM schedule (Subsection 3.8.K.2) where the as-built schedule actual dates are converted into actual activity durations and actual driving lag durations. The total float values of the collapsible as-built schedule can be used to show the as-built critical path if the as-built logic was determined using the enhanced logic rules that not only uses the early-start and early-finish dates to simulate the as-built dates but also determine the proper late start and late finish dates. While there is acknowledgement that this is technically feasible, currently there is no agreement among practitioners on a common set of these enhanced logic rules.\n\nThe closest the analyst can come to determining the as-built critical path is to cumulatively collect from successive schedule updates the activities that reside on the critical path between the data date and the data date of the subsequent update. The same technique can be used to determine the as- built near-critical activities. If the updates are available, the following is the recommended protocol.\n\na. Use all the critical and near-critical activities in the baseline schedule. If modifications were made to the baseline for analysis purposes, use both sets of critical activities, before and after the modification.\n\n16 Obviously this would be caused by reasons beyond just pure slippage. An example would be insertion of activities or a chan ge to more restrictive logic.\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n117 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nb. For each schedule update, use the critical and near-critical chains of activities starting\n\nimmediately to the right of the data date.\n\nc. Also use the predecessor activities to the left of the data date that precede the chains found in (b)\n\nabove.\n\nd. Use the longest path and near-longest path criteria in addition to the lowest float path criterion in\n\nidentifying the activities.\n\ne.\n\nIf weather or other calendar factors are at issue, also use a baseline recalculated with an alternate calendar reflecting actual weather or other factors to gather critical and near-critical activities.\n\nAn enhanced protocol would add the following sets to the recommended protocol.\n\nf.\n\nIf appropriate, perform (b) through (d) above using different calculation modes17 if they are available.\n\ng. Where significant non-progress revisions were made during the updating process, repeat (b)\n\nthrough (d) using the progress-only, bifurcated schedules (see Subsection 2.3.D)\n\nh.\n\nIf appropriate, examine the resource-leveled critical path as opposed to hard-tied sequences, sometimes called preferential logic, based solely on resources.\n\ni. Conversely, if resource constraint is at issue and the schedule logic does not reflect the constraint, insert resource-based logic to obtain a critical path that considers all significant constraints.\n\nFrom the above steps the lowest float path will generally be the as-built critical path. However, the expert must use his/her expert opinion based on all the facts, to identify the as-built critical path from among the identified candidates.

Enhanced Implementation Protocols\n\n1. Daily Delay Measure\n\nThe as-planned vs. as-built methodology can be used in more complicated cases if the data is available. Since the basic implementation protocol is applicable only for very simple cases, this more advanced method should be used if possible. However, even this more enhanced implementation is useful only for simple projects where the sequence of work did not vary significantly from the baseline schedule.\n\na. The as-built should be a fully progressed baseline schedule allowing for a one-to-one comparison of each schedule activity. This is essential as activity descriptions and ID numbers often change as the project advances.\n\nb. On larger schedules and projects that are active for long periods of time, it is often desirable to use a database comparison between actual dates determined from the as-built analysis with the LATE planned dates. This comparison will allow the selection of the more significant activities for graphical comparison. Prepare a table comparing the planned duration or a schedule activity to the actual duration and determine the cause for each significant variance.\n\nc. Prepare a table comparing the planned controlling predecessor logic of schedule activity to the actual controlling predecessor logic and determine the cause for each significant variance.\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n48 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nd.\n\nIf an edited baseline schedule was used, the analysis should proceed using both the unaltered baseline as well as the modified baseline. A comparison between the two sets of results will assist the analysis in identifying the likely and realistic progress of the job.\n\ne. Arithmetic calculations performed on a daily basis can provide significantly more accurate information if the as-built data is available at the appropriate level of detail. This method is called Daily Delay Measure (DDM). DDM is an enhanced variation for the identification of activities that are candidates for critical and near critical paths. DDM compares late start and finish dates with as-built start and finish dates.\n\nIt can be done on a daily, weekly, or any other periodic basis. By depicting the number of days a schedule activity is ahead or behind the planned late dates, a determination at any point of the status of any schedule activity is possible.\n\nWhile the comparison can be made between the early start/finish dates and the actual dates, it is better to compare late start/finish dates with actual dates. By using late dates, any delay indicated by the comparison is a true delay rather than consumption of float. As a result of that exercise, any float associated with the duration of a schedule activity is excluded. Activities that have float (and accordingly are not on the as-planned critical path) will generally not appear to have been delayed during the early stages of analysis, since they will appear to be \u201cahead\u201d of schedule because of their float. As the analysis progresses through a project\u201fs performance however, the activities that initially had float, if they were delayed for duration in excess of the value of that float, can become critical, thus overtaking one or more of those activities originally on the project\u201fs as-planned critical path. While late dates are preferred in performing the analysis, in some CPM schedules, late dates do not represent a consistent or practical plan for execution of the work even if the early dates do. In these cases, it is better to use early dates, taking into account the float values.\n\nThe DDM can also identify possible changes in the as-built critical path if the analysis is done on a frequent, possibly daily basis, even within the actual duration of activities. In this case, there are several alternative assumptions that can be made to identify progress within an activity duration: (1) if accurate progress data is available on a regular basis, this regular progress can be used (realistically this is very rare in most construction projects); (2) progress can be assumed to advance at an equal rate each period, for example a 10- day activity would be assumed to advance 10 percent each day; or (3) a different progress rate, perhaps conforming to a more typical bell-curve distribution.\n\nG. Identification of Critical and Near-Critical Paths\n\nIn this method, the emphasis should be on the as-built critical path as opposed to the as-planned critical path. Since this methodology does not use a computational CPM, the methodology relies more extensively on expert evaluation.\n\n\n\nIdentify and understand all related contractual language.\n\nFrom the fully populated baseline schedule, identify the calculated critical path of the as-planned using the longest path and the lowest total float concept of the validated as-planned schedule.\n\nFrom the fully populated as-built schedule,"

While contractors usually intend to perform their work in accordance with the early dates, delay to an activity cannot be measured until the activity is actually delayed\u2013is later than the planned late dates. The basic steps in the analysis are as follows:\n\n1.\n\nIdentify the baseline or other schedule that will form the as-planned schedule. Ideally, this schedule has been approved or accepted by both parties and reflects the full scope of the work, includes proper logic from the start of the project through completion, and reflects neither progress nor post-commencement mitigations of delay. This schedule is usually a CPM model, so that even without functioning CPM logic and modeling, the original planned logic should be used in analysis and interpretation. Alternatively, a simple comparison can be performed using graphic time-scaled diagrams. In this situation, no explicit schedule logic is evident, although the sequence and timing will imply certain logical connections.\n\n2.

The analysis should advance through the comparison by identifying for each activity: (a) delayed starts, (b) extended durations, and (c) delayed finishes. Since the as-built analysis is performed using a 7-day calendar, it is important that all durations be in calendar days. In this manner, it is possible to identify where the most significant delays occurred, where there were mitigations of delay through implementation of out-of-sequence logic and possible accelerations through shorter than planned durations.\n\n4. Arithmetic calculations performed at the start and completion of each as-built activity provide a detailed view of the relative delay of every as-built activity. The most delayed series of activities can be ascertained using this method and can often be used as a starting point for identifying the as-built critical path. Expert judgment is required to separate the as-built critical path (based on industry experience and contemporaneous evidence as discussed in Subsection 4.3.C) from the various set of most delayed activities at any particular time.\n\n5. Simultaneous delays, whether they are pacing delays (see Subsection 4.2.B) or concurrent delays (see Subsection 4.2.A), should be identified and confirmed as being on the critical path.\n\n6. As the analysis continues and advances through the as-planned schedule, it is likely that it will become less accurate since contemporaneous adjustments to the contractor\u201fs plan will supersede the original logic. For this reason, particular care must be exercised during the analysis of the later stages of the project.\n\n7. Extended durations that extend the Late Finish Date for any activity should be examined for the cause. This will determine the cause of the delays along the critical path.\n\n8. Similarly, any duration with shorter than planned durations may indicate reductions in work scope or acceleration by the contractor.\n\n9.\n\nIf time extensions have been granted, they should be considered both at the time they were granted and at the end of the analysis. Time extensions should be considered at the time granted when the reasons for delayed performance are identified through the comparison as well as identification of the as-built critical path. Time extensions will change the overall delay to the project and may therefore override apparent delays to specific activities.\n\nIf the baseline schedule has both early and late dates, the analysis should be performed using late dates unless a review of the late dates reveal that the logic associated with the late dates is significantly different than the logic of the early dates. In this situation, the analysis should be performed using early dates with the understanding that adjustments for available float may need to be considered. A schedule with logic that is incomplete or has logic associated with the late dates that appears significantly different from the logic associated with the early dates should be considered for correction in accordance with Subsection 2.1.B.\n\nThe minimum implementation of this method is applicable only to relatively simple cases and should not be used for long duration cases or where there are significant changes between the original planned work scope and the final as-built scope. For the purpose of this MIP, a \u201esimple case\u201f is defined as one in which there is a single clearly defined chain of activities on the longest path that stayed as the longest path throughout the performance of the project."

Observational / Static / Periodic (MIP 3.2)\n\nA. Description\n\nLike MIP 3.1, 3.2 is an observational technique that compares the baseline or other planned schedule to the as-built schedule or a schedule update that reflects progress. But, this method analyzes the project in multiple segments rather than in one whole continuum. Because this is essentially an enhancement of MIP 3.1, as a practical matter, the implementation of MIP 3.2 requires that prerequisites for MIP 3.1 be implemented first.\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Observational, Static, Periodic Method Graphic Example\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n45 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nIn its range of implementation from simple to sophisticated, it shares the characteristics of MIP 3.1. In its simplest application, the method does not involve any explicit use of CPM logic and can be simply an observational study of start and finish dates of various activities. It can be performed using a simple graphic comparison of the as-planned schedule to the as-built schedule. A more sophisticated implementation compares the dates and the relative sequences of the activities, tabulates the differences in activity duration and logic ties, seeks to determine the causes, and explains the significance of each variance. In its most sophisticated application, it can identify on a daily basis the most delayed activities and candidates for the as-built critical path.\n\nThe advantage of performing this analysis in two or more time periods is that the identification of delays or accelerations can be more precisely identified to particular events. Generally the more time periods, the more closely related the analysis is to the events that actually occurred. The fact that the analysis is segmented into periods does not significantly increase or decrease the technical accuracy of this method when compared to MIP 3.1 because the comparison remains between the as-built and baseline or original as-planned schedule. However, the segmentation is useful in enhancing the organization of the analysis process and enables prioritization. It also may add to the effectiveness of the presentation of the analysis.\n\nMIP 3.2 is classified as a static logic method because it primarily relies on the single set of CPM logic underlying the baseline schedule or other planned schedule. Note that a similar method as described in MIP 3.3 is classified as a dynamic logic method because that method uses a series of updates schedule with logic that may be different from the baseline and from each other. MIP 3.2 is distinguished from MIP 3.3 in that while the analysis is performed in segments, they are segments of the as-planned and as-built without reference to schedule updates that are contemporaneous to those segments. The method is classified as periodic because the analysis is performed in periodic segments rather than in one continuous project period.\n\nB. Common Names\n\n1. As-planned vs. as-built\n\n2.

            " calendar, such as one that excludes the winter months for work, carry less float than activities with less restrictive work-day calendar. Thus, by adding or removing a few holidays in the calendar, float can be manipulated.\n\nThe only way to avoid gaps, discontinuities, and work-day conversions is to use only one calendar consisting of a seven-day week.\n\n3. Precedence Logic / Lead and Lag\n\nSimple logic is finish-to-start with a lag value of zero, denoted as FS0. Other known types of logic relationships are start-to-start (SS), finish-to-finish (FF), and start-to-finish (SF). Most software allows the use of these logic types along with the use of lead and lag values other than zero, including negative values. The use of lag values greater than zero with FS-type of logic absorbs otherwise available float. It is possible to assign lag values that are less than zero, called negative lags. Negative lags associated with the FS-type of logic have the effect of overlapping the associated schedule activities, thereby increasing float.\n\nLag: An offset or delay from an activity to its successor. Lag can be positive or negative; it is measured in the planning unit for the project and based on the calendar of the predecessor activity.\n\nLead Time: An overlap between tasks that have a dependency. For example, if a task can start when its predecessor is half finished, the analyst can specify a finish-to-start dependency with a lead time of 50 percent for the successor task. The analyst enters lead time as a negative lag value or as a percent complete lag value in some software packages.\n\nLag Time: A delay between tasks that have a dependency. For example, if the analyst needs a two-day delay between the finish of one task and the start of another, the analyst can establish a finish-to-start dependency and specify a two-day lag time. The analyst can enter lag time as a positive value.\n\n4. Start and Finish Constraints\n\nSetting a start constraint to a date that is later than what would be allowed by a controlling predecessor would decrease the float on the schedule activity. Similarly, setting a finish constraint to a date that is earlier than what would be allowed by a controlling predecessor would also decrease float on the schedule activity. Both techniques can be used to force activity paths to carry negative float.\n\nThere are also features that force the schedule activity to carry no total float or no free float. Also certain types of constraints force the assignment of zero float value by fixing dates on which the activity will be performed, overriding associated precedence logic.\n\n5. Various Calculation Modes\n\nFundamental schedule and float calculation methods can usually be selected by the analyst, further complicating the effort to identify the critical path and quantify float. Below are examples\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n120 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nrelated to various methods of schedule calculation, duration calculation, and float calculation.\n\na. Schedule Calculation\n\nRetained Logic: If the analyst selects retained logic, remaining activities are scheduled with out-of-sequence progress according to the network logic. When used, scheduling software schedules the remaining duration of an out-of-sequence activity according to current network logic - after its predecessors.\n\nProgress Override: Progress override ignores logic and affects the schedule only if out- of-sequence progress occurs. If the analyst selects progress override, remaining activities are scheduled with out-of-sequence progress as though they have no constraints from incomplete predecessors with start-to-start relationships and can progress without delay. Not only does the successor activity act as if it has only limited predecessor constraints, the float of the predecessor activity also reflects the loss of that successor relationship. Progress override treats an activity with out-of-sequence progress as though it has no predecessor constraints; its remaining duration is scheduled to start immediately, rather than wait for the activities predecessors to complete. However, neither the longest path nor most-negative float techniques can guarantee an accurate depiction of the critical path when using actual dates if out of sequence status is involved.\n\nb. Duration Calculation\n\nContiguous Activity Duration: Contiguous activity duration requires that work on an activity occur without interruption. For early dates, this type of logic affects the start dates for an activity when the finish dates are delayed by a finish relationship from a preceding activity or by a finish constraint. If the finish dates of an activity are delayed, the start dates are delayed also.\n\n\n\nInterruptible Activity Duration: For early dates, interruptible scheduling affects how start dates of an activity are treated when the finish dates are delayed by a finish relationship from a preceding activity or by a finish constraint. If the finish dates of an activity are delayed, the start dates are not delayed. \u2013 The duration"

Quantification of Delay Durations and Activity Level Variances\n\nThere are two different modes of quantification of delay durations. They are the retrospective actual mode (hindsight) and the prospective forecasted mode (blindsight). The hindsight mode relies on project documentation of actual chronological events that constitute the set of activities considered to be the cause or the effect of delays. The blindsight mode uses activities, sequences and durations that were estimated prior to the occurrence of the alleged delay. Where the focus of the analysis is to identify actual schedule impact, the hindsight mode is preferred. If the focus of the analysis is to identify potential impact or to ascertain the state of mind of the project team at the time of the impact, the analyst would use the blindsight mode.\n\nUnder either of these modes, there are two fundamentally different methods for quantifying delay durations. They are the variance method and the independent method.\n\na. Variance Method\n\nThe variance method is a comparative method that determines the delay duration by computing the ALV between the as-built activity duration and the unimpacted or planned activity duration obtained from the baseline schedule, an updated schedule or other non-CPM sources such as a measured-mile analysis or some reasoned estimate. This method is purely mathematical in nature. Two figures (a planned and an actual) are subtracted from each other to compute the variance. These two figures may be dates, durations, or productivity measurements. Thus, the entire variance needs to be tied to one or more causes for the variance.\n\nb.\n\nIndependent Method\n\nIn contrast, the independent method is not comparative. The delay duration is determined from project documentation that contemporaneously chronicled or otherwise recorded the occurrence of the delay or quantified the impact resulting from a delay event. Under this method, the answer to the question whether causation has been established or not depends on the type and content of the documentation that was used for the quantification.\n\nThese methods do not have to be exclusive of each other. The analyst may elect to use a mixture of the two methods depending on the nature of the delay or the availability of necessary documentation. Also, one may elect to use both methods for each delay to evaluate and reconcile the different outcomes resulting from the differences.\n\nFor example, if the documentation consists of a daily diary entry that states that a specific activity was suspended for that specific day pending an investigation of a differing site condition, there is prima facie establishment of causation (one day of delay is clearly stated). But if the documentation is a letter stating that, \u201cduring the previous month many activities experienced extensive delays due to Owner-changes,\u201d further analysis to determine the delay duration and which activities were affected by the delaying events will be needed.\n\nThe example below is given to illustrate the difference between the variance and independent method: Suppose that the ALV for a specific activity is ten days. In the variance method, the entire ten days will be distributed among the responsible parties. However, in the independent method, the ALV is not even looked at in the beginning. Instead, the analyst researches project documentation to determine the delay amount. Therefore, if the project documentation only states that the activity was delayed three days by an event, the remaining seven days of the ALV will not be assigned to this delay and may not be assigned to the party responsible for this delay. If the documentation states the delay event was twelve days, the analyst will consider the delay to the activity was twelve days but since the ALV is ten, the other two days may have been made up via acceleration. Therefore, in the variance method, the analyst is guided to the delay amount by the\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n36 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\namount of ALV. On the other hand, in the independent method, the analyst does not review the ALV, but relies on what is written in the documentation to make its determination of delay amount.\n\n4. Cause of Variance\n\nWhat caused the variances often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. In researching, evaluating and modeling the cause-and-effect relationships, the analyst must be aware that these relationships are often successively linked into a chain of alternating causes and effects.

            " Least Float vs. Negative Float\n\nThe use of Negative Float or Longest Path Theory (Subsection 4.3.A.2.) for identification of critical activities can have a profound effect on the calculation of concurrent delay. The disparity stems from divergent approaches to criticality. Virtually all forensic delay methodologies provide for extensions of contract time on the critical path only. Therefore, the definition of the critical path is of utmost importance.\n\nThe Negative Float Theory assumes criticality on any activity that has negative total float relative to a contractual milestone. There is a certain practicality to this approach since most parties working from a CPM schedule will generally move to advance any activities that have negative total float because they are all essential to the maintenance or recovery of project delay. The Longest Path Theory provides for criticality on the longest path only, even if other secondary paths are late with regard to a contractual milestone. Under the Longest Path Theory, all paths shorter than the longest path (even those with negative total float) have positive total float with respect to the longest path and are therefore not critical. In contrast, under the Negative Float Theory, any delays, occasioned by negative total float, occurring during the same measurement period are potential candidates for concurrency.\n\nConcurrency analyses should always be consistent with the contract\u201fs definition of criticality. While it is beyond the scope of this document to catalogue the variations in contractual specifications, one relatively common definition is worth mentioning. Namely, some contracts include in the definition of concurrent delay that it cause a critical path delay. The requirement that the concurrent delay be critical, in effect, excludes other delay events with float values greater than the critical path from being evaluated for offsets against compensable delays. This view comports with the Literal Theory. It can be argued that absent such contract definition, non-critical delays can be used to offset compensable delay on a day-for-day basis after the expenditure of relative float against the critical path. This view comports with the Functional Theory.\n\n3. Cause of Delay vs. Effect of Delay\n\nAnother philosophical dichotomy that complicates the evaluation of concurrency is the difference between the proximate (immediate) cause of the delay and effect of the delay.\n\nFor example, assume a schedule activity with a planned duration of five days experiences work suspensions on the second day and the fifth day, thereby extending the duration by two days. The delaying events are on the second and the fifth day, but the delay-effect is on the sixth and the seventh day. The differences become much larger on activities with longer planned durations that experience extended delays. A good example would be delayed approval of a submittal that stretches for weeks and months.\n\nThe philosophical difference rests on the observation by the delay-effect adherents that there is no \u201edelay\u201f until the planned duration has been exhausted. In contrast, the delay-cause adherents\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n107 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nmaintain that the identification of delay should be independent of planned or allowed duration, and instead should be driven by the nature of the event. The disadvantage of the delay-cause theory is that if there are no discrete events that cause a schedule activity to exceed its planned duration, it would have to fall back to the delay-effect method of identifying the delay. Conversely, in cases where the delay was a result of a series of discrete events, the delay-effect method of chronological placement of delay would often be at odds with contemporaneous documentation of such discrete events.\n\nThe difference in outcome is pronounced under the literal theory, since it affects whether or not a delay is identified as concurrent. Under the functional theory the significance to the outcome depends on whether the analyst is using a static method (MIP 3.1, 3.6 or 3.8) or a dynamic method (MIP 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7 or 3.9). Using a static method, the cause-effect dichotomy makes no difference because the entire project is one networked continuum. But using a dynamic method, it does make a difference because the chronological difference between the cause and effect may determine the analysis interval in which the delay is analyzed.\n\nThere are two solutions to reconcile this potential dichotomy between the static and dynamic methods. One solution is to use the cause theory where discrete delay events are identifiable and to use the effect theory where there are no identifiable discrete events that led to the delay. But note that in many cases the identification of discrete causes is a function of diligence in factual research, which is in turn dictated by time and budget allowed for the analysis. The second solution is to review the delay on an activity basis and not to review the events on a daily basis within the event. This solution comports with the reality that delays that occur at the outset"

            "\n\nIn the early days of the development of the CPM, the longest path was the path with the lowest float. Using simple network logic (finish-to-start) only, the critical path of an un-progressed CPM network calculated using the longest path criterion or the lowest float value criterion is the same.\n\nIt is only when some advanced scheduling techniques are applied to the network model that the paths identified using these different criteria diverge (see Subsection 4.3.D.).\n\nMost practitioners would agree that the longest path is the true critical path. Even with the use of advanced techniques, if basic network rules (see Subsection 2.1) are observed the total float value is a reasonably accurate way of identifying the critical path. But, note that float values are displayed using workday units defined by the underlying calendar assigned to the schedule activity instead of in 7-day calendar units. Therefore, activities on a chain with uniform network tension may display different float values.\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n114 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\n2. Negative Float: Zero Float School vs. Lowest Float Value School\n\nWhen a project is behind schedule, the network model may display negative values for float. Technically, this results from the fact that the earliest possible dates of performance for the activities are later than the latest dates by which they must be performed in order for the overall network to complete by a constrained finish date. Thus, the negative value is a direct indication of how many work days the schedule activity is behind schedule.\n\nAs discussed in Subsection 4.2.D.2.there are two schools of thought in interpreting the criticality of activity paths carrying negative float values. One school, which will be called the zero float school, maintains that all activities with negative float are, by definition, critical, assuming the definition of critical path is anything less than total float of one unit. The other school, which will be called the lowest value school, insists that only the activity paths that carry the lowest value are critical.\n\nIn the context of the two critical path schools, longest path versus total float value, the total float value adherents tend to align with the zero float thinking while the longest path adherents tend to think along the lines of the lowest float value school. However, neither one of these philosophical alignments is guaranteed, nor are they logically inconsistent.\n\nWhich one is correct depends on which principles are considered. If only CPM principles are used to evaluate the theories, the lowest value school is correct. The zero float school may have an arguable point if contractual considerations are brought into play, since all paths showing negative float are impacting (albeit not equally) the contractual completion date.\n\nFor the purpose of this RP, the procedures and methods use the lowest value theory as the valid criterion for criticality where negative float is shown. Thus, the true float value of a schedule activity carrying negative float will be calculated as the relative total float against the lowest float value in the network. For example, if the lowest float value in the network is minus 100, and another schedule activity shows a value of negative 20, the true float for that schedule activity, based on relative total float, is 80, assuming both activities are defined by the same calendar (see Subsection 4.3.D.2). The potential also exists for fragnets of activities to have lower total float than the project\u201fs longest or critical path. This occurs when activities are tied to intermediate project milestones (and not to overall project completion). If such a scenario is observed, the analysis should also consider the contractual relationship or requirement for the intermediate milestones.\n\nB. Quantifying \u201eNear-Critical\u201f\n\nThe purpose of quantifying the near-critical path is to reduce the effort of identifying and analyzing potential concurrent delays. A rational system of identifying all activities and delays that are near- critical is the first step in objectively streamlining the process of evaluating the schedule for concurrent delays. Thus, if the analyst chooses to analyze all delays and activities on a network, the quantification of near-critical is unnecessary. But in most cases, analyzing all activities, especially on large complex schedules, is excessively time consuming and unnecessary.\n\nNear-critical delays have the greatest potential of becoming concurrent delays. This is because a near-critical delay, upon consumption of relative float against the critical path delay, will become critical. Therefore the near-critical delays are the most likely suspects of concurrency, and must be analyzed for partial concurrency to the extent that the net effect of that delay may exceed such relative float.\n\nThe determination of what a \u201enear critical\u201f activity is depends on the following factors:\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n115 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011"

        "question": "How do analysts use variance and independent methods to analyze ALVs and their impact on project timelines?",
        "ground_truth": "Analysts use the variance method to analyze ALVs by computing the difference between the as-built activity duration and the unimpacted or planned activity duration. This method is mathematical and involves subtracting planned figures from actual figures to compute the variance, which is then tied to one or more causes. In contrast, the independent method does not compare planned and actual figures but instead relies on project documentation that records the occurrence of delays or quantifies their impact. The independent method determines delay duration based on the type and content of the documentation used for quantification. Analysts may use a mixture of both methods depending on the nature of the delay or the availability of documentation.",

            "-and-go operations, weather delays, or from discrete periods of added work or suspensions. In addition, extended durations may be due to experiencing lower labor productivity than planned for when the activity duration was developed. Unless the delay is fully attributable to a discretely identifiable period of exclusive extra work performance, quantification of this type of delay requires some estimating on the part of the analyst.\n\nb. Distinguishing ALV from Project-Level Variance (PLV)\n\nThe ALV should be distinguished from the project-level variance (PLV) which is also a variance but at the overall project level. While the ALVs occur close in time to the causes, i.e. in the same period, the PLV may be months apart from the actual cause(s of the delay PLV is the result of the aggregation of ALV\u201fs after taking into account network float. Within the context of this RP, ALVs are considered \u201edelays\u201f regardless of the amount of float they carry. The activity experiences a delay if an ALV exists regardless if the delay affects the project completion date, i.e. the PLV.\n\nc. Distinguishing Delay-Cause from Delay-Effect\n\nIt is important for the analyst to be able to distinguish the cause of delay from the resulting effect. For example, a fully updated schedule may show extended activities and delayed start of activities relative to their controlling predecessors. While the cause may not be apparent, a competent statusing of the schedule will show the delay-effects. What caused the initial ALV for the chain of activities often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. If, on the other hand, a delay was appropriately inserted into the schedule as a new activity as a predecessor to the activity\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n34 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nwith the start delay, the cause of the ALV is readily apparent.\n\nThe identification of delay-causes is a focus in the latter phases of delay analysis, during causation analysis.\n\nd. Delay Characterization is Independent of Responsibility\n\nALV\u201fs are considered \u201cdelays\u201d independent of the responsibility for those variances. Thus an ALV can be contractor-caused or owner-caused, but it is still a delay. Similarly, the characterization of delays as \u201eexcusable\u201f, \u201ecompensable\u201f, \u201econcurrent\u201f and \u201epaced\u201f are attributes that are assigned well after the initial delay analysis starts by examining ALVs based on the causation analysis that has been performed after the schedule analysis is completed.\n\n2. Identifying and Collecting Delays\n\na. Two Main Approaches to Identification and Collection\n\ni. Cause-Based Approach\n\nThis approach starts with the collection of suspected causes of delays and then determining the effect they had on the baseline schedule and individual schedule updates. It is a \u201ecauses in search of effects\u201f approach. This is often used in the additive modeling methods. For example, an analysis may review the monthly reports, searching for issues that may have caused delays to the project.\n\nii. Effect-Based Approach\n\nThis approach is the opposite of the cause-based approach. It starts by compiling a set of ALV\u201fs and then identifies the causes of those variances. Specific documents that are associated with the time-frame, activity description, and amount of ALV\u201fs are reviewed to see if they could have created this variance. This approach is applied in the observational and the subtractive modeling methods. In the majority of the analysis scenarios, the effect-based approach is the more economical approach.\n\nb. Criticality of the Delay\n\nIt is important for an analyst to not prejudge criticality, nor limit the collection process to only those delays perceived to affect the critical path, especially if the delays are being identified for a modeled method. In addition, a path that is near critical in one window maybe become critical in the next especially if delays are being extracted from the critical path. For example, in the Modeled / Subtractive / Single Simulation (MIP 3.8) and the Modeled / Subtractive / Multiple Base (MIP 3.9) methods, as delays are being stripped from the critical path, the path will \u201ccollapse\u201d and the first near critical path will become critical. This is an iterative method and therefore, paths may collapse numerous times so that a path that originally has plenty of float becomes the critical path. The ultimate critical path quantification from the effect of each delay will eventually be determined in the modeling process. It is impossible for the analyst to know what the final critical path is until all of these delays have been added in (MIP",

Quantification of Delay Durations and Activity Level Variances\n\nThere are two different modes of quantification of delay durations. They are the retrospective actual mode (hindsight) and the prospective forecasted mode (blindsight). The hindsight mode relies on project documentation of actual chronological events that constitute the set of activities considered to be the cause or the effect of delays. The blindsight mode uses activities, sequences and durations that were estimated prior to the occurrence of the alleged delay. Where the focus of the analysis is to identify actual schedule impact, the hindsight mode is preferred. If the focus of the analysis is to identify potential impact or to ascertain the state of mind of the project team at the time of the impact, the analyst would use the blindsight mode.\n\nUnder either of these modes, there are two fundamentally different methods for quantifying delay durations. They are the variance method and the independent method.\n\na. Variance Method\n\nThe variance method is a comparative method that determines the delay duration by computing the ALV between the as-built activity duration and the unimpacted or planned activity duration obtained from the baseline schedule, an updated schedule or other non-CPM sources such as a measured-mile analysis or some reasoned estimate. This method is purely mathematical in nature. Two figures (a planned and an actual) are subtracted from each other to compute the variance. These two figures may be dates, durations, or productivity measurements. Thus, the entire variance needs to be tied to one or more causes for the variance.\n\nb.\n\nIndependent Method\n\nIn contrast, the independent method is not comparative. The delay duration is determined from project documentation that contemporaneously chronicled or otherwise recorded the occurrence of the delay or quantified the impact resulting from a delay event. Under this method, the answer to the question whether causation has been established or not depends on the type and content of the documentation that was used for the quantification.\n\nThese methods do not have to be exclusive of each other. The analyst may elect to use a mixture of the two methods depending on the nature of the delay or the availability of necessary documentation. Also, one may elect to use both methods for each delay to evaluate and reconcile the different outcomes resulting from the differences.\n\nFor example, if the documentation consists of a daily diary entry that states that a specific activity was suspended for that specific day pending an investigation of a differing site condition, there is prima facie establishment of causation (one day of delay is clearly stated). But if the documentation is a letter stating that, \u201cduring the previous month many activities experienced extensive delays due to Owner-changes,\u201d further analysis to determine the delay duration and which activities were affected by the delaying events will be needed.\n\nThe example below is given to illustrate the difference between the variance and independent method: Suppose that the ALV for a specific activity is ten days. In the variance method, the entire ten days will be distributed among the responsible parties. However, in the independent method, the ALV is not even looked at in the beginning. Instead, the analyst researches project documentation to determine the delay amount. Therefore, if the project documentation only states that the activity was delayed three days by an event, the remaining seven days of the ALV will not be assigned to this delay and may not be assigned to the party responsible for this delay. If the documentation states the delay event was twelve days, the analyst will consider the delay to the activity was twelve days but since the ALV is ten, the other two days may have been made up via acceleration. Therefore, in the variance method, the analyst is guided to the delay amount by the\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n36 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\namount of ALV. On the other hand, in the independent method, the analyst does not review the ALV, but relies on what is written in the documentation to make its determination of delay amount.\n\n4. Cause of Variance\n\nWhat caused the variances often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. In researching, evaluating and modeling the cause-and-effect relationships, the analyst must be aware that these relationships are often successively linked into a chain of alternating causes and effects. In addition, an ALV may be created by more than one cause.\n\n",

Now our labour head also drastically reduced due to less working spaces. Our Progress is also lagging by Dry Wall & Suspended Ceiling Sub Contractor's as well. Up to now, they have handed over Level 10 to Level 15, even though there are some surface undulations/alignment issues are visible; however, it is also clearly addressed to SPLL officially.\n\nCurrently, we require working clearance from level 50 to level 68 for vertical tower areas and also, we require working clearance basement & podium areas; all the issues are clearly indicated with relevant photos and hatched drawings and addressed and also to SPLL Department officially, we need the clearance for yard areas at vertical tower from level 30 to level 50 where block surface areas require plastering. It is also informed to SPLL department officially.\n\nIDPL is instructed to commence the Fire Escape Stair Case (ST2), for that we need clearance and barricades for vertical tower areas. If we get the significant working area clearance from SPLL, then we can increase the labour head counts and can use machinery application to catch up with SPLL & IDPL time schedule.\u201d105\n\n268.

Is the work being performed consistently or piecemeal?\n\nObjective identification of the controlling activities is difficult, if not impossible, without the benefit of any schedule updates or at least a baseline CPM schedule with logic. Therefore, in the absence of competent schedule updates, the analyst must err on the side of over-inclusion in selecting the controlling set of as-built activities. The determination must be a composite process based on multiple sources of project data including the subjective opinion of the percipient witnesses.

This does not mean that the observational methods (MIP 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5) are immune from manipulation. Since they rely on the baseline and the updates, the source schedules must be checked for manipulation prior to use in the forensic process. Also, during the forensic process, the dynamic methods are subject to manipulation through the frequency, duration, and placement of analysis intervals (Subsection 4.3.B.2) and through subjective assignment of progress data in reconstructing updates (MIP 3.5).\n\nThe use of these techniques per se is not evidence of intentional manipulation. It must be stressed that there are legitimate uses and good reasons, albeit limited, for these features. Even in the absence of \u201egood reason\u201f, the feature could have resulted from laziness or even misguided attempts to improve the schedule. At any rate, schedules used for forensic schedule analysis must minimize the use of these techniques (see Subsection 2.1).\n\nThe policy of this RP is to be \u201esoftware neutral\u201f. This means that procedures and recommendations are made without regard to the brand or version of software used for analysis. However, the examples of techniques used to manipulate results, listed below, contain descriptions of the features found in some software manufacturer\u201fs manuals\n\n1. Resource Leveling and Smoothing\n\nThis technique uses available float to balance the resources necessary for executing the schedule. Some analysts maintain that resource leveling is the technical embodiment of pacing (see Subsection 4.2.F).\n\nResource leveling is the process of determining and minimizing the effect of resource availability on the schedule. Resource leveling can be used to resolve resource conflicts by rescheduling activities to times when sufficient resources are available. When resources are not available, activities can be split; activity durations can be stretched to reduce their resource per time period requirements; or, activity durations can be compressed to take advantage of ample resource supplies. During forward leveling, activities may be shifted to a later date (the leveled date). In backward leveling, activities may be moved earlier in time.\n\nResource smoothing is an optional resource leveling method that resolves resource conflicts by delaying activities that have positive float. Resource smoothing uses the available positive float and incrementally increases the availability limits.\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n119 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\n2.

Quantification of Delay Durations and Activity Level Variances\n\nThere are two different modes of quantification of delay durations. They are the retrospective actual mode (hindsight) and the prospective forecasted mode (blindsight). The hindsight mode relies on project documentation of actual chronological events that constitute the set of activities considered to be the cause or the effect of delays. The blindsight mode uses activities, sequences and durations that were estimated prior to the occurrence of the alleged delay. Where the focus of the analysis is to identify actual schedule impact, the hindsight mode is preferred. If the focus of the analysis is to identify potential impact or to ascertain the state of mind of the project team at the time of the impact, the analyst would use the blindsight mode.\n\nUnder either of these modes, there are two fundamentally different methods for quantifying delay durations. They are the variance method and the independent method.\n\na. Variance Method\n\nThe variance method is a comparative method that determines the delay duration by computing the ALV between the as-built activity duration and the unimpacted or planned activity duration obtained from the baseline schedule, an updated schedule or other non-CPM sources such as a measured-mile analysis or some reasoned estimate. This method is purely mathematical in nature. Two figures (a planned and an actual) are subtracted from each other to compute the variance. These two figures may be dates, durations, or productivity measurements. Thus, the entire variance needs to be tied to one or more causes for the variance.\n\nb.\n\nIndependent Method\n\nIn contrast, the independent method is not comparative. The delay duration is determined from project documentation that contemporaneously chronicled or otherwise recorded the occurrence of the delay or quantified the impact resulting from a delay event. Under this method, the answer to the question whether causation has been established or not depends on the type and content of the documentation that was used for the quantification.\n\nThese methods do not have to be exclusive of each other. The analyst may elect to use a mixture of the two methods depending on the nature of the delay or the availability of necessary documentation. Also, one may elect to use both methods for each delay to evaluate and reconcile the different outcomes resulting from the differences.\n\nFor example, if the documentation consists of a daily diary entry that states that a specific activity was suspended for that specific day pending an investigation of a differing site condition, there is prima facie establishment of causation (one day of delay is clearly stated). But if the documentation is a letter stating that, \u201cduring the previous month many activities experienced extensive delays due to Owner-changes,\u201d further analysis to determine the delay duration and which activities were affected by the delaying events will be needed.\n\nThe example below is given to illustrate the difference between the variance and independent method: Suppose that the ALV for a specific activity is ten days. In the variance method, the entire ten days will be distributed among the responsible parties. However, in the independent method, the ALV is not even looked at in the beginning. Instead, the analyst researches project documentation to determine the delay amount. Therefore, if the project documentation only states that the activity was delayed three days by an event, the remaining seven days of the ALV will not be assigned to this delay and may not be assigned to the party responsible for this delay. If the documentation states the delay event was twelve days, the analyst will consider the delay to the activity was twelve days but since the ALV is ten, the other two days may have been made up via acceleration. Therefore, in the variance method, the analyst is guided to the delay amount by the\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n36 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\namount of ALV. On the other hand, in the independent method, the analyst does not review the ALV, but relies on what is written in the documentation to make its determination of delay amount.\n\n4. Cause of Variance\n\nWhat caused the variances often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. In researching, evaluating and modeling the cause-and-effect relationships, the analyst must be aware that these relationships are often successively linked into a chain of alternating causes and effects. In addition, an ALV may be created by more than one cause.\n\n",
            "Causation is established primarily on the quality of documents available for the analyst at the time of the schedule analysis. Some documents are more reliable than others. Development of a document-type list and a reliability assessment for each document type are often the first steps prior to a detailed review of the record. This list is essential for two reasons. First, the analyst will become familiar with the types of documents that are available for review. Discussions with the project team concerning types of documents as well as the chronology of events will optimize the causation research process. For example, if the analyst is not aware that daily construction reports exist, and instead relies on monthly reports for determining causation, its conclusions of delay amount and impact may be very different.\n\n5. Assigning or Assuming Variance Responsibility\n\nWhen the forensic schedule analyst does not possess adequate information to make an independent determination of responsibility for the delay, the analyst may have to proceed with the analysis based on an assumption. Such assumptions should be noted and clearly stated as part of the final analysis product along with the basis of such assumption.\n\na. Contractor delay is any delay event caused by the contractor or those under its control, or the risk of which has been assigned solely to the contractor . Typical examples of contractor delay events include, but are not limited to, delays caused by rework resulting from poor workmanship, subcontractor delays, insufficient labor, management and coordination problems, failure to order necessary materials and failure to secure contractual approvals.\n\nb. Owner delay is any delay event caused by the owner, or the risk of which has been assigned solely to the owner . Examples of owner-delay events include, but are not limited to, delays resulting from change orders, extended submittal review, directed suspension of work, delayed owner-furnished equipment, differing site conditions, and defective contract documents.\n\nc. Force majeure delay is any delay event caused by something or someone other than the owner (including its agents) or the contractor (or its agents), or the risk of which has not been assigned solely to the owner or the contractor by contract language and/or local industry custom and practice. Examples of force majeure delays include, but are not limited to, delays caused by acts of God, inclement weather, acts of war, extraordinary economic disruptions, strikes, and other events not foreseeable at the time of contract. Many contracts specifically define force majeure events. Although strictly not a \u201eforce majeure\u201f event, delays caused by parties external to the contract may also be classified under this category if there are no contractual risk assignment to the contractor or the owner for such delays.\n\nB.

Lag is an offset or delay from an activity to its successor and can be positive or negative. Positive lag absorbs available float, while negative lag overlaps schedule activities, increasing float.

            " calendar, such as one that excludes the winter months for work, carry less float than activities with less restrictive work-day calendar. Thus, by adding or removing a few holidays in the calendar, float can be manipulated.\n\nThe only way to avoid gaps, discontinuities, and work-day conversions is to use only one calendar consisting of a seven-day week.\n\n3. Precedence Logic / Lead and Lag\n\nSimple logic is finish-to-start with a lag value of zero, denoted as FS0. Other known types of logic relationships are start-to-start (SS), finish-to-finish (FF), and start-to-finish (SF). Most software allows the use of these logic types along with the use of lead and lag values other than zero, including negative values. The use of lag values greater than zero with FS-type of logic absorbs otherwise available float. It is possible to assign lag values that are less than zero, called negative lags. Negative lags associated with the FS-type of logic have the effect of overlapping the associated schedule activities, thereby increasing float.\n\nLag: An offset or delay from an activity to its successor. Lag can be positive or negative; it is measured in the planning unit for the project and based on the calendar of the predecessor activity.\n\nLead Time: An overlap between tasks that have a dependency. For example, if a task can start when its predecessor is half finished, the analyst can specify a finish-to-start dependency with a lead time of 50 percent for the successor task. The analyst enters lead time as a negative lag value or as a percent complete lag value in some software packages.\n\nLag Time: A delay between tasks that have a dependency. For example, if the analyst needs a two-day delay between the finish of one task and the start of another, the analyst can establish a finish-to-start dependency and specify a two-day lag time. The analyst can enter lag time as a positive value.\n\n4. Start and Finish Constraints\n\nSetting a start constraint to a date that is later than what would be allowed by a controlling predecessor would decrease the float on the schedule activity. Similarly, setting a finish constraint to a date that is earlier than what would be allowed by a controlling predecessor would also decrease float on the schedule activity. Both techniques can be used to force activity paths to carry negative float.\n\nThere are also features that force the schedule activity to carry no total float or no free float. Also certain types of constraints force the assignment of zero float value by fixing dates on which the activity will be performed, overriding associated precedence logic.\n\n5. Various Calculation Modes\n\nFundamental schedule and float calculation methods can usually be selected by the analyst, further complicating the effort to identify the critical path and quantify float. Below are examples\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n120 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nrelated to various methods of schedule calculation, duration calculation, and float calculation.\n\na. Schedule Calculation\n\nRetained Logic: If the analyst selects retained logic, remaining activities are scheduled with out-of-sequence progress according to the network logic. When used, scheduling software schedules the remaining duration of an out-of-sequence activity according to current network logic - after its predecessors.\n\nProgress Override: Progress override ignores logic and affects the schedule only if out- of-sequence progress occurs. If the analyst selects progress override, remaining activities are scheduled with out-of-sequence progress as though they have no constraints from incomplete predecessors with start-to-start relationships and can progress without delay. Not only does the successor activity act as if it has only limited predecessor constraints, the float of the predecessor activity also reflects the loss of that successor relationship. Progress override treats an activity with out-of-sequence progress as though it has no predecessor constraints; its remaining duration is scheduled to start immediately, rather than wait for the activities predecessors to complete. However, neither the longest path nor most-negative float techniques can guarantee an accurate depiction of the critical path when using actual dates if out of sequence status is involved.\n\nb. Duration Calculation\n\nContiguous Activity Duration: Contiguous activity duration requires that work on an activity occur without interruption. For early dates, this type of logic affects the start dates for an activity when the finish dates are delayed by a finish relationship from a preceding activity or by a finish constraint. If the finish dates of an activity are delayed, the start dates are delayed also.\n\n\n\nInterruptible Activity Duration: For early dates, interruptible scheduling affects how start dates of an activity are treated when the finish dates are delayed by a finish relationship from a preceding activity or by a finish constraint. If the finish dates of an activity are delayed, the start dates are not delayed. \u2013 The duration"

In preparing a modeled analysis the analyst inserts or extracts activities representing delay events into or from a CPM network and compares the calculated results of the\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n14 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\n\u201ebefore\u201f and \u201eafter\u201f states.\n\nCommon examples of the modeled method are the collapsed as-built, time impact analysis, and the impacted as-planned.\n\nC. Layer 3: Specific Methods\n\nAt the third layer are the specific methods.\n\n1. Observational Methods\n\nUnder the observational method, further distinction is drawn on whether the evaluation considers just the original schedule logic or the additional sets of progressive schedule logic that were developed during the execution of the project, often called the dynamic logic.\n\na. Static Logic Observation\n\nA specific subset of the observational method, the static logic variation compares a plan consisting of one set of network logic to the as-built state of the same network. The term \u201estatic\u201f refers to the fact that observation consists of the comparison of an as-built schedule to just one set of as-planned network logic.\n\nThe as-planned vs. as-built is an example of this specific method.\n\nb. Dynamic Logic Observation\n\nIn contrast with the static logic variation, the dynamic logic variation typically involves the use of schedule updates whose network logic may differ to varying degrees from the baseline and from each other. This variation considers the changes in logic that were incorporated during the project.\n\nThe contemporaneous period analysis is an example of this specific method. Note that this category does not occur under the prospective timing mode because the use of past updates indicates that the analysis is performed using retrospective timing.\n\n2. Modeled Methods\n\nThe two distinctions under the modeled method are whether the delays are added to a base schedule or subtracted from a simulated as-built.\n\na. Additive Modeling\n\nThe additive modeling method consists of comparing a schedule with another schedule that the analyst has created by adding schedule elements (i.e. delays) to the first schedule for the purpose of modeling a certain scenario.\n\nThe additive modeling methods include the impacted as-planned and some forms of the window analysis method. The MIP 3.6 (aka \u201cTIA\u201d) can also be classified as an additive modeling method. This term or its equivalent, time impact evaluation (TIE), has been used in contracts and specifications to refer to other basic and specific methods as well.\n\nb. Subtractive Modeling\n\nThe subtractive modeling method consists of comparing a CPM schedule with another\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n15 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nschedule that the analyst has created by subtracting schedule elements (i.e. delays) from the first schedule for the purpose of modeling a certain scenario.\n\nThe collapsed as-built is one example that is classified under the subtractive modeling method.\n\nD. Layer 4: Basic Implementation\n\nThe fourth layer consists of the differences in implementing the methods outlined above. The static logic method can be implemented in a gross mode or periodic mode. The dynamic logic method can be implemented as contemporaneous: as-is, contemporaneous split, contemporaneous modified, or recreated. The additive or subtractive modeling method can be implemented as a single base with simulation or a multiple base with simulation.\n\n1. Gross Mode or Periodic Mode\n\nThe first of the two basic implementations of the static logic variations of the observational method is the gross mode. Implementation of the gross mode considers the entire project duration as one whole analysis period without any segmentation.\n\nThe alternate to the gross mode is the periodic mode. Implementation of the periodic mode breaks the project duration into two or more segments for specific analysis focusing on each segment. Because this is an implementation of the static logic method, the segmented analysis periods are not associated with any changes in logic that may have occurred contemporaneously with these project periods.\n\n2. Contemporaneous / As-Is or Contemporaneous / Split\n\nThis basic implementation",
            " pair occurs under the dynamic logic variation of the observation method. Both choices contemplate the use of the schedule updates that were prepared contemporaneously during the project. However the as-is implementation evaluates the differences between each successive update in its unaltered state, while the split implementation bifurcates each update into the pure progress and the non-progress revisions such as logic changes.\n\nThe purpose of the bifurcation is to isolate the schedule slippage (or recovery) caused solely by work progress based on existing logic during the update period from that caused by non-progress revisions newly inserted (but not necessarily implemented) in the schedule update.\n\n3. Modified or Recreated\n\nThis pair, also occurring under the dynamic logic variation of the observational method, involves the observation of updates. Unlike the contemporaneous pair, however, this implementation involves extensive modification of the modified implementation, or the recreation of entire updates where no contemporaneous updates exist, as in the recreated implementation.\n\nthe contemporaneous updates, as\n\nin\n\n4. Single Base, Simulation or Multi-Base, Simulation\n\nThis basic implementation pair occurs under the additive and the subtractive modeling methods. The distinction is whether when the modeling (either additive or subtractive) is performed, the delay activities are added to or extracted from a single CPM network or multiple CPM networks.\n\nFor example, a modeled analysis that adds delays to a single baseline CPM schedule is a single\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n16 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nbase implementation of the additive method, whereas one where delays are extracted from several as-built simulations is a multi-base simulation implementation of the subtractive method.\n\nA single base additive modeling method is typically called the impacted as-planned. Similarly the single simulation subtractive method is called the collapsed as-built. The multi-base, additive simulation variation is often called a window analysis.\n\nThe nine method implementation protocols (MIP) in Section 3 represent the instances of basic protocols based on the distinctions outlined in Layer 4.\n\nE. Layer 5: Specific Implementation\n\n1. Fixed Periods vs. Variable Periods / Grouped Periods\n\nThese specific implementations are the two possible choices for segmentation under all basic implementations except gross mode and the single base / simulation basic implementations. They are not available under the gross mode because the absence of segmentation is the distinguishing feature of the basic gross mode. They are not available under the single base / simulation basic implementation because segmentation assumes a change in network logic for each segment; the single base simulation uses only one set of network logic for the model.\n\nIn the fixed period specific implementation, the periods are fixed in date and duration by the data dates used for the contemporaneous schedule updates, usually in regular periods such as monthly. Each update period is analyzed. The act of grouping the segments for summarization after each segment is analyzed is called blocking.\n\nThe variable period/grouped period specific implementation establishes analysis periods other than the update periods established during the project by the submission of regular schedule updates. The grouped period implementation groups together the pre-established update periods while the variable period implementation establishes new periods whose lines of demarcation may not coincide with the data dates used in the pre-established periods and/or which can be determined by changes in the critical path or by the issuance of revised or recovery baseline schedules. This implementation is one of the primary distinguishing features of the variable period analysis method.\n\n2. Global (Insertion or Extraction) vs. Stepped (Insertion or Extraction)\n\nThis specific implementation pair occurs under the single base, simulation basic implementation, which in turn occurs under the additive modeling and the subtractive modeling specific methods. Under the global implementation delays are either inserted or extracted all at once, while under the stepped implementation, the insertion or the extraction is performed sequentially (individually or grouped).\n\nAlthough there are further variations in the sequence of stepping the insertions or extractions, usually the insertion sequence is from the start of the project towards the end, whereas stepped extraction starts at the end and proceeds towards the start of the project.\n\n1.5. Underlying Fundamentals and General Principles\n\nA. Underlying Fundamentals\n\nAt any given point in time on projects, certain work must be completed at that point in time so the completion of the project does not slip later in time.

            "-and-go operations, weather delays, or from discrete periods of added work or suspensions. In addition, extended durations may be due to experiencing lower labor productivity than planned for when the activity duration was developed. Unless the delay is fully attributable to a discretely identifiable period of exclusive extra work performance, quantification of this type of delay requires some estimating on the part of the analyst.\n\nb. Distinguishing ALV from Project-Level Variance (PLV)\n\nThe ALV should be distinguished from the project-level variance (PLV) which is also a variance but at the overall project level. While the ALVs occur close in time to the causes, i.e. in the same period, the PLV may be months apart from the actual cause(s of the delay PLV is the result of the aggregation of ALV\u201fs after taking into account network float. Within the context of this RP, ALVs are considered \u201edelays\u201f regardless of the amount of float they carry. The activity experiences a delay if an ALV exists regardless if the delay affects the project completion date, i.e. the PLV.\n\nc. Distinguishing Delay-Cause from Delay-Effect\n\nIt is important for the analyst to be able to distinguish the cause of delay from the resulting effect. For example, a fully updated schedule may show extended activities and delayed start of activities relative to their controlling predecessors. While the cause may not be apparent, a competent statusing of the schedule will show the delay-effects. What caused the initial ALV for the chain of activities often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. If, on the other hand, a delay was appropriately inserted into the schedule as a new activity as a predecessor to the activity\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n34 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\nwith the start delay, the cause of the ALV is readily apparent.\n\nThe identification of delay-causes is a focus in the latter phases of delay analysis, during causation analysis.\n\nd. Delay Characterization is Independent of Responsibility\n\nALV\u201fs are considered \u201cdelays\u201d independent of the responsibility for those variances. Thus an ALV can be contractor-caused or owner-caused, but it is still a delay. Similarly, the characterization of delays as \u201eexcusable\u201f, \u201ecompensable\u201f, \u201econcurrent\u201f and \u201epaced\u201f are attributes that are assigned well after the initial delay analysis starts by examining ALVs based on the causation analysis that has been performed after the schedule analysis is completed.\n\n2. Identifying and Collecting Delays\n\na. Two Main Approaches to Identification and Collection\n\ni. Cause-Based Approach\n\nThis approach starts with the collection of suspected causes of delays and then determining the effect they had on the baseline schedule and individual schedule updates. It is a \u201ecauses in search of effects\u201f approach. This is often used in the additive modeling methods. For example, an analysis may review the monthly reports, searching for issues that may have caused delays to the project.\n\nii. Effect-Based Approach\n\nThis approach is the opposite of the cause-based approach. It starts by compiling a set of ALV\u201fs and then identifies the causes of those variances. Specific documents that are associated with the time-frame, activity description, and amount of ALV\u201fs are reviewed to see if they could have created this variance. This approach is applied in the observational and the subtractive modeling methods. In the majority of the analysis scenarios, the effect-based approach is the more economical approach.\n\nb. Criticality of the Delay\n\nIt is important for an analyst to not prejudge criticality, nor limit the collection process to only those delays perceived to affect the critical path, especially if the delays are being identified for a modeled method. In addition, a path that is near critical in one window maybe become critical in the next especially if delays are being extracted from the critical path. For example, in the Modeled / Subtractive / Single Simulation (MIP 3.8) and the Modeled / Subtractive / Multiple Base (MIP 3.9) methods, as delays are being stripped from the critical path, the path will \u201ccollapse\u201d and the first near critical path will become critical. This is an iterative method and therefore, paths may collapse numerous times so that a path that originally has plenty of float becomes the critical path. The ultimate critical path quantification from the effect of each delay will eventually be determined in the modeling process. It is impossible for the analyst to know what the final critical path is until all of these delays have been added in (MIP",
            "\u201fs 3.6 and 3.7 or extracted out (MIP\u201fs 3.8 and 3.9).\n\nAlso, float consumption and ownership can be relevant where issues involve disruption, loss of productivity, and constructive acceleration regardless of the criticality of the activity.\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n35 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\n3. Quantification of Delay Durations and Activity Level Variances\n\nThere are two different modes of quantification of delay durations. They are the retrospective actual mode (hindsight) and the prospective forecasted mode (blindsight). The hindsight mode relies on project documentation of actual chronological events that constitute the set of activities considered to be the cause or the effect of delays. The blindsight mode uses activities, sequences and durations that were estimated prior to the occurrence of the alleged delay. Where the focus of the analysis is to identify actual schedule impact, the hindsight mode is preferred. If the focus of the analysis is to identify potential impact or to ascertain the state of mind of the project team at the time of the impact, the analyst would use the blindsight mode.\n\nUnder either of these modes, there are two fundamentally different methods for quantifying delay durations. They are the variance method and the independent method.\n\na. Variance Method\n\nThe variance method is a comparative method that determines the delay duration by computing the ALV between the as-built activity duration and the unimpacted or planned activity duration obtained from the baseline schedule, an updated schedule or other non-CPM sources such as a measured-mile analysis or some reasoned estimate. This method is purely mathematical in nature. Two figures (a planned and an actual) are subtracted from each other to compute the variance. These two figures may be dates, durations, or productivity measurements. Thus, the entire variance needs to be tied to one or more causes for the variance.\n\nb.\n\nIndependent Method\n\nIn contrast, the independent method is not comparative. The delay duration is determined from project documentation that contemporaneously chronicled or otherwise recorded the occurrence of the delay or quantified the impact resulting from a delay event. Under this method, the answer to the question whether causation has been established or not depends on the type and content of the documentation that was used for the quantification.\n\nThese methods do not have to be exclusive of each other. The analyst may elect to use a mixture of the two methods depending on the nature of the delay or the availability of necessary documentation. Also, one may elect to use both methods for each delay to evaluate and reconcile the different outcomes resulting from the differences.\n\nFor example, if the documentation consists of a daily diary entry that states that a specific activity was suspended for that specific day pending an investigation of a differing site condition, there is prima facie establishment of causation (one day of delay is clearly stated). But if the documentation is a letter stating that, \u201cduring the previous month many activities experienced extensive delays due to Owner-changes,\u201d further analysis to determine the delay duration and which activities were affected by the delaying events will be needed.\n\nThe example below is given to illustrate the difference between the variance and independent method: Suppose that the ALV for a specific activity is ten days. In the variance method, the entire ten days will be distributed among the responsible parties. However, in the independent method, the ALV is not even looked at in the beginning. Instead, the analyst researches project documentation to determine the delay amount. Therefore, if the project documentation only states that the activity was delayed three days by an event, the remaining seven days of the ALV will not be assigned to this delay and may not be assigned to the party responsible for this delay. If the documentation states the delay event was twelve days, the analyst will consider the delay to the activity was twelve days but since the ALV is ten, the other two days may have been made up via acceleration. Therefore, in the variance method, the analyst is guided to the delay amount by the\n\nCopyright 2011 AACE\u00ae International, Inc.\n\nAACE\u00ae International Recommended Practices\n\nForensic Schedule Analysis\n\n36 of 134\n\nApril 25, 2011\n\namount of ALV. On the other hand, in the independent method, the analyst does not review the ALV, but relies on what is written in the documentation to make its determination of delay amount.\n\n4. Cause of Variance\n\nWhat caused the variances often does not appear on the schedule but must be investigated and researched using project documents, data and witness interviews. In researching, evaluating and modeling the cause-and-effect relationships, the analyst must be aware that these relationships are often successively linked into a chain of alternating causes and effects. In addition, an ALV may be created by more than one cause.\n\n"
