Additionally, changes in treaties or interpretations thereof, including the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules, can also impact the provision for income taxes.",
        "contexts": [
            " our business. Any litigation can be costly, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\n\nOur operating results may be negatively impacted and damage to our reputation may occur due to the production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products.\n\nAs is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could negatively impact our operating results.\n\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could negatively impact our results.\n\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be negatively impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate alternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and\n\n70\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncommitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\nOur business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events (including as a result of global climate change).\n\nOur corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our customers, suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding or other weather-related activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of supply chain components and delivery of products. In addition, global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently and/or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, changing precipitation, and flooding. We have not to date experienced a material event as a result of these kinds of natural disasters; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nTerrorism, war, and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future acts of terrorism, war (such as the on-going Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas"

        "ground_truth": "Global economic downturns or periods of economic uncertainty can adversely affect customers, increasing the credit risks related to financing activities. This can lead to significant bankruptcies among customers, causing economic or financial losses, which could harm the business and have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial condition.",

            "; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations.\n\nIssues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.\n\nWe currently incorporate AI technology in certain of our products and services and in our business operations. Our research and development of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect our and our customers\u2019 adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. AI-related issues, deficiencies and/or failures could (i) give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union, and others, and as a result of new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws; (ii) damage our reputation; or (iii) otherwise materially harm our business.\n\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\n\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States, and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers\u2019 ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\n\n69\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\n\nBecause a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.\n\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\n\nOur success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel.

You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance-Based Stock Units, including the grant, vesting or settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units, or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired at vesting or the receipt of any dividends with respect to such Shares; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms or any aspect of the Performance-Based Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you become subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.\n\n(b) Prior to any relevant tax, withholding or required deduction event, as applicable, and in order to receive any Shares or other benefit\n\nin relation to the Performance-Based Stock Units, you agree to make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable tax, withholding, required deduction and payment on account of any obligations of the Company and/or the Employer that arise in connection with the Performance-Based Stock Units. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any obligations related to Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation payable to you by the Company or the Employer; (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization); (3) withholding of Shares that would otherwise be issued upon settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units; or (4) requiring you to satisfy the liability for Tax-Related Items by means of any other arrangement approved by the Company.\n\n(c) If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to",
            " have been issued the\n\nfull number of Shares subject to the vested Performance-Based Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of your participation in the Plan. You agree to provide the Company and/or its stock plan broker/administrator with the information necessary to manage your Tax-Related Items withholding and acknowledge that should you fail to provide such information on a timely basis, the Company and/or its stock plan broker/administrator may be obligated to withhold amounts from you and it may be necessary for you to seek a refund directly from the tax authorities. Depending on the withholding method, the Company or Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates.\n\n(d) Finally, you will pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be\n\nrequired to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan or your acquisition of Shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to this Agreement unless and until such obligations are satisfied.\n\n7. Tax and Legal Advice. You represent, warrant and acknowledge that neither the Company nor your Employer have made any warranties or representations to you with respect to any Tax-Related Items, legal or financial consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and you are in no manner relying on the Company, your Employer or the Company\u2019s or the Employer\u2019s representatives for an assessment of such consequences. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE LAWS GOVERNING THIS AWARD ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN PROFESSIONAL TAX, LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISOR REGARDING ANY PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK UNITS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMPANY AND YOUR EMPLOYER ARE NOT PROVIDING ANY TAX, LEGAL, OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, NOR IS THE COMPANY OR YOUR EMPLOYER MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AWARD. NOTHING STATED HEREIN IS INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING TAXPAYER OR OTHER PENALTIES.\n\n8. Non-Transferability of Performance-Based Stock Units. Performance-Based Stock Units shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached,\n\ngarnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor\u2019s process, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law.\n\n9. Restriction on Transfer. Regardless of whether the transfer or issuance of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock\n\nUnits has been registered under the Securities Act or has been registered or qualified under the securities laws of any state, the Company may impose additional restrictions upon the sale, pledge, or other transfer of the Shares (including the placement of appropriate legends on stock certificates and the issuance of stop-transfer instructions to the Company\u2019s transfer agent) if, in the judgment of the Company and the Company\u2019s counsel, such restrictions are necessary in order to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state, or any other law including all applicable foreign laws.\n\n10. Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Instructions. Stock certificates evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units may bear such restrictive legends and/or appropriate stop-transfer instructions may be issued to the Company\u2019s transfer agent as the Company and the Company\u2019s counsel deem necessary under applicable law or pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n11. Representations, Warranties, Covenants, and Acknowledgments. You hereby agree that in the event the Company and the Company\u2019s counsel deem it necessary or advisable in the exercise of their discretion, the transfer or issuance of the Shares issued pursuant to the Performance-Based Stock Units may be conditioned upon you making certain representations, warranties, and acknowledgments relating to compliance with applicable laws.\n\n12. Voting, Dividend and Other Rights. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and except as set forth below, you shall not have any voting\n\nrights or any other rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company unless and until the Performance-Based Stock Units are settled in Shares. Dividend equivalents shall accrue on the Performance-Based Stock Units and will be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Performance- Based Stock Units to which they attach as set forth in the Plan or this Agreement and to the extent vested will be settled in additional Shares upon the settlement of the Performance-Based Stock Units as set forth in Section 5 above.\n\n13"

The mailing address of our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at sec.gov: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such filings are available free of charge. The information published on our website, or any other website referenced herein, is not incorporated into this report.\n\nStrategy and Priorities\n\nAcross the globe, businesses and organizations of every size are leveraging Cisco technology to transform and drive better outcomes and experiences. We also help customers navigate emerging technological shifts. Our strategy is to securely connect everything to make those desired outcomes and experiences possible for our customers.\n\nIn today\u2019s dynamic environment, our customers have three key priorities: build modern and resilient infrastructure; protect against the cyber threats of today and tomorrow; and harness the power of AI and data.\n\nThese customer priorities are central to how we innovate and develop our technology. First, we provide the underlying network connectivity for our customers, whether they are connecting traditional branch offices, data centers, smart grids, video devices, electric vehicles, or other devices. Second, we help protect those network connections and the underlying technology architecture against cyber threats. Third, through the visibility we have into data across the network, connected devices and applications, we provide context and insights to our customers about what is happening in their technology architecture, not only in their on-premise infrastructure and private data centers, but also their cloud infrastructure. Our ongoing innovation is delivered, managed and optimized through a combination of hardware, software and subscriptions, in line with the flexible consumption models our customers request.\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCisco can help customers connect, protect and draw actionable insights from their technology. We do this in service of delivering the digital resilience our customers need for today\u2019s complex and unpredictable world.\n\nCustomer Priorities\n\nModernize Infrastructure\n\nIn an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure, including through automation to manage and monitor each connection in real time.\n\nWe continue to transform our enterprise networking portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form an integrated architecture. Our vision is to build a unified management platform experience for on-premise and cloud operating models, that simplifies and helps secure networking for customers at scale.\n\nOur Observability offerings collect and process daily measurements from customers\u2019 owned and unowned networks, providing automated insights, proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers to enable them to reduce mean time to resolution of issues and improve IT productivity and user experience.\n\nFor the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data reside. We continue to make significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics, which we believe are the building blocks for the internet for the future.\n\nAs part of modernizing their infrastructure, customers of every size are also looking for solutions to help them communicate more effectively with their customers and to connect their employees more efficiently for productivity. Our collaboration portfolio, which includes interoperable devices and our cloud contact center, provides those solutions, and serves as a key component of smart buildings, powered over ethernet, that we believe will define the workplaces of the future.\n\nImprove Cybersecurity\n\nWith the rapid growth in modern applications, hyper-distributed architecture and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, customers see cybersecurity as a top priority. Our differentiated security strategy is based on three pillars: moving from point solutions to a platform comprehensively integrated with the infrastructure; infusing security into the fabric of the network; and harnessing the depth and breadth of telemetry data from Cisco and with our acquisition of Splunk Inc. (\u201cSplunk\u201d) to prevent, detect, and respond to sophisticated attacks.\n\nHarness the Power of AI and Data\n\nAI represents a generational shift in technology and is driving an order of magnitude higher requirement for network connectivity. We provide network infrastructure to power AI training and inference workloads for both webscalers and enterprises. We help to scale our customers\u2019 network infrastructure with high-density routers and switches, improved network management, and high-performance optics. We are reinventing data center operations for our customers by",
            " simplifying the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of fabrics, compute, networking and storage.\n\nWe can help give customers visibility across the network, security solutions, applications and their own business data. With this breadth and scale of data, we can help deliver differentiated insights and context to customers, leading them to more informed proactive decisions and better business results.\n\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with our Strategy and Priorities, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including the risk factor entitled \u201cWe depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\u201d For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nProducts and Services\n\nOur products and services are grouped into the following categories:\n\nNetworking\n\nNetworking consists of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and servers. These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, modernize and transform their infrastructure. We believe it is critical for us to deliver continuous value to our customers. Our objective is to converge our on-premise solutions with our cloud managed solutions across our networking portfolio.\n\nOur Switching portfolio encompasses campus switching as well as data center switching offerings. Our campus switching offerings provide the foundation for converged data, voice, video, and Internet of Things (IoT) services. These switches offer enhanced security and reliability and are designed to scale efficiently as our customers grow. Within campus switching are our Catalyst 9000 series of switches that include hardware with embedded software, along with a software subscription referred to as Cisco DNA. Cisco DNA provides automation, analytics and security features and can be centrally monitored, managed, and configured. Also, within campus switching we have a range of Meraki cloud-managed switches for customers who prefer ease of management in lean-IT environments. Our data center switching offerings, led by the Nexus 9000 series, provide the foundation for mission critical data centers with high availability, scalability, and security across traditional data centers and private and public cloud data centers. We continue to add greater visibility and analytics across our networks and applications, enabling us to deliver better experiences for our customers.\n\nInternet Infrastructure primarily consists of our routed optical networking solutions. We are focusing on transforming connectivity to the Internet and the cloud environment by efficiently meeting the growing demand for low-latency and higher speeds. Our routed optical networking systems and our pluggable optic solutions, allow us to transform the economics of building and operating networks for our service provider customers, including our webscale customers. Cisco Silicon One is our single, unified, and scalable networking silicon architecture which we have expanded from a routing-focused solution to one which addresses the webscale switching market through the combination of its high-performance, feature-rich, and low-power characteristics. Our Cisco 8000 series routers, which are based on our Silicon One, provide broad capacity in high-density designs, allowing our customers to reduce operational footprints, lower carbon emissions, and transition to more efficient network architectures.\n\nOur Enterprise Routing portfolio interconnects public and private wireline and mobile networks, delivering highly secure and reliable connectivity to campus, data center and branch networks.

We are focusing on transforming connectivity to the Internet and the cloud environment by efficiently meeting the growing demand for low-latency and higher speeds. Our routed optical networking systems and our pluggable optic solutions, allow us to transform the economics of building and operating networks for our service provider customers, including our webscale customers. Cisco Silicon One is our single, unified, and scalable networking silicon architecture which we have expanded from a routing-focused solution to one which addresses the webscale switching market through the combination of its high-performance, feature-rich, and low-power characteristics. Our Cisco 8000 series routers, which are based on our Silicon One, provide broad capacity in high-density designs, allowing our customers to reduce operational footprints, lower carbon emissions, and transition to more efficient network architectures.\n\nOur Enterprise Routing portfolio interconnects public and private wireline and mobile networks, delivering highly secure and reliable connectivity to campus, data center and branch networks. Our routing solutions are designed to meet the scale, reliability, and security needs of our large to small customers.\n\nOur Wireless portfolio provides indoor and outdoor wireless coverage designed for seamless roaming use of voice, video, and data applications. These products include wireless access points and controllers that are on-premise and cloud managed, and which, combined with our Switching portfolio, delivers a converged access solution that is powerful, yet simple.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity consists of our Network Security, Identity and Access Management, Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings. Security is a leading priority for our customers, regardless of size or industry. We continue to invest in resources across our security portfolio focused on cloud-based offerings, AI-enhanced threat detection and end-to-end security architectures. Our Threat Intelligence, Detection, and Response offerings incorporate the technologies of Splunk to prevent, detect and respond to sophisticated cyber attacks. This product category includes the Splunk Platform and Splunk Security offerings after the acquisition of Splunk, although the Splunk Platform has use cases that can also be applicable for Observability offerings. With our acquisition of Splunk in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we have begun to integrate our solutions, starting with Cisco Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Splunk Enterprise Security. Additionally, we continue to invest in expanding our SASE architecture by delivering combined network and security functionality in a single cloud-native service.\n\nCollaboration\n\nCollabor"

DFCCIL has delayed the appointment of the System Contractor by one year and eight months and in fact the System Contractor was not even in place when the Engineer gave its Recommendation No. 1 dated 10.06.2015. Under the Contract, the System Contractor was to be appointed by DFCCIL by 14.03.2014. As a result, the Contractor has been delayed in achieving its progress milestones because the said delay in appointment of the System Contractor would affect Milestone 2 completion dates as Milestone 2 depends upon the completion of integrated testing along with the System Contactor apart from the delay in completion of Milestone 1 being carried forward to Milestone 2.\n\n83\n\nEXTENT OF ENTITLEMENT TO EXTENSION OF TIME:\n\n67.

To carry out such delay analysis, the Claimant engaged Mr. Barry B. Bramble, an international construction consultant and expert in construction delay and Jeffery R. Salmonsen, a senior scheduler/planner and principal of Bentwood Associates. The methodology adopted as explained by them in the report is as follows: In performing an independent evaluation of the project delays, we endeavoured to undertake the Time Slice Windows Analysis in accordance with the Society of Construction Law\u2019s Delay and Disruption Protocol, Second Edition (February 2017) which method analyzes the cause and effect of delays, determining the critical path contemporaneously and determining impact retrospectively. The Time Slice Windows Analysis methodology involves the sequential (chronological) insertion or addition of activities representing the delays or changes into the approved baseline schedule and the contemporaneous schedule updates, and review of project documents in order to evaluate the impact of delays. Given the circumstances, facts, available schedules and programmes on the DFCC Lot 101 project, the Time Slice method is appropriate for the analysis of the critical delays that prolonged the overall Lot 101 project completion. The Time Slice Analysis methodology has gained widespread acceptance by planners, schedulers, arbitrators, tribunals, courts and others in the construction industry throughout the world as one of the most appropriate ways to evaluate the impact of delays to project schedules.\n\ninto\n\nIn a Time Slice analysis, analytical \u201ctime slices\u201d are generally taken periodically when key events and delays occur. Given the duration of the original schedule (1499 days, approximately 50 months), the currently projected contract performance period according to the 31 July 2020 schedule (approximately 95 months), and the extent of the delays on the project (approximately 39 months), a month by month delay analysis was not warranted.\n\n84\n\nAlso, the JV alleged that numerous delay-causing events were caused by DFCC impacting the JV\u2019s performance for approximately 45 months. Given these circumstances, an individual analysis of each delay-causing event was not warranted.\n\nThis Time Slice analysis indicates that Milestone MS-3 should be adjusted to 27 April 2021"

            " $\n\n(e) Indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, we have indemnification obligations to other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time or circumstances within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount for claims made under the indemnification obligations due to uncertainties in the litigation process, coordination with and contributions by other parties and the defendants in these types of cases, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular case and agreement. Historically, indemnity payments made by us have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\n\n(f) Legal Proceedings\n\nBrazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years.\n\nThe asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $143 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $830 million for interest, and $325 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 27, 2024.\n\nWe have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years.\n\nCentripetal On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (\u201cCentripetal\u201d) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that several of our products and services infringe eleven Centripetal U.S. patents. After two bench trials and various administrative actions and appeals, we have been found either to not have infringed any of the patents or the patents have been invalidated. Centripetal has appealed one of the invalidity decisions and it has also appealed the non-infringement judgment of the District Court and both of those proceedings are ongoing.\n\nBetween April 2020 and February 2022, Centripetal also filed complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany (\u201cGerman Court\u201d), asserting a total of five patents and one utility model. Centripetal sought damages and injunctive relief in all cases. In various proceedings in 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have been found to have not infringed three patents, one patent was invalidated, the utility model was invalidated, and the infringement action on the final patent is stayed due to an invalidity action heard on June 6, 2024 in the Federal Patent Court, in which all claims, aside from one auxiliary claim, were found invalid, for which we are awaiting the entry of judgment from the Federal Patent Court. Centripetal\u2019s appeals of two of the non-infringement findings remain pending and, on March 27, 2024, the Court of Appeals rejected Centripetal\u2019s appeal of the third non-infringement finding.\n\n92\n\n159 (34) 125\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.
