The amount remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges on the de-designation date was $1,857.

        "ground_truth": "Calcined bauxite producers in China are facing challenges due to environmental controls and supply shortages. The use of dynamite has been severely curtailed in the mining industry on environmental grounds, leading to reduced domestic bauxite mined output. Additionally, many processing plants in Tianjin were shut down due to violations of environmental norms, further impacting production. These factors have contributed to a supply shortage and increased raw material prices.",

            " much higher than last year, it means nothing,\" one producer in Haicheng told IM. \"There is not much inventory to sell. There is a clear contradiction now \u2013 I want this price level to continue when supply is tight, but when supply is not tight prices will fall.\"\n\nAnother issue is export advantages transferring to the domestic market, according to local sellers: \"Now foreign buyers can\u2019t get the goods in time like before, unless they have their own factories in China and can pay cash, like domestic buyers,\" one exporter in Dalian told IM.\n\n\"Even so, they can\u2019t be promised to get the volume in time. [The situation is much worse] for foreign buyers using LC payments.\"\n\nEurope\n\nThe market in Europe has meanwhile remained stable on existing price levels.\n\nLocal sources point to stockpiles of all magnesia grades present in Europe, which European suppliers and customers are now resorting to while China is short.\n\nPrices of European FM remain at $640-750/tonne FOB Europe, according to IM\u2019s 25 July assessment.\n\nAt least three suppliers active in Europe told IM they have no FM volumes available for sale, with another supplier of high-grade magnesia products saying he is \"fully booked\".\n\nOther European magnesia prices have remained unchanged. Calcined agricultural magnesia stands at \u20ac240-300/tonne CIF EU ports. Electrical-grade fused magnesia is priced at $1,500-2,450/tonne ex-works UK. Raw magnesite, max 3.5% SiO2 content, is also stable at \u20ac65-80/tonne FOB East Mediterranean.\n\nIn North America, electrical-grade fused magnesia is trading at $1,700-2,500/tonne ex-works US, while refractory-grade fused magnesia stands at $900-1,400/tonne FOB US.\n\n5832\n\nChinese bauxite prices increase on raw material shortage\n\nBy Yoke Wong Published: Friday, 28 July 2017\n\nReduced bauxite ore output in China has caused a supply shortage of raw material for the production of the calcined refractory mineral. This has pushed prices higher, as the ongoing anti-pollution measures are also supporting the market.\n\nSpot calcined bauxite prices increased amid rising raw material cost and supply shortage due to mining restrictions in China.\n\nThe use of dynamite was severely curtailed in the mining industry throughout China on environmental grounds since early this year and domestic bauxite mined output were reduced as a result.\n\nAlthough China is the world's largest importer of metallurgical-grade bauxite, this material is not suitable for calcining due to the low alumina and high iron content.\n\nCalcined bauxite producers in China mainly relied on domestic output in Shanxi and Guizhou provinces, where there are deposits of high-grade bauxite (70% Al2O3 and above) with low iron content. However, the bauxite deposits in China are mostly state-owned, with some estimating that more than 90% of the country\u2019s bauxite mine resources are in the hand of the Chinese government.\n\nMany calcined bauxite producers sourced raw material supply from Aluminium Corp of China Ltd (Chalco), one of the biggest aluminium producers in the country. But Chalco announced in mid-May that it had suspended approximately 970,000 tpa of alumina capacity across its refineries, according to IM\u2019s sister publication Metal Bulletin.\n\nAs a result of lower alumina capacity, less bauxite is required as feedstock for the refineries. Lower domestic bauxite availability has pushed the raw material prices upwards, with many sales requiring pre-payment, Chinese producers told IM.\n\nTwo Chinese producers cited bauxite ore prices as high as Chinese renminbi (Rmb) 1,500 ($222/tonne), up 15% from Rmb1,300 ($193/tonne) in June. Note: IM does not track or publish prices for bauxite ore.\n\nTo further compound supply issues, many processing plants in Tianjin were shut down due to violations to environmental norms, pushing all grades of calcined bauxite prices up over the past fortnight.\n\nSpot prices of 85% refractory-grade bauxite (85% Al2O3/2.0/3.15-3.2/0-6mm) increased to $360-370/tonne on an FOB Xingang basis, up an average of $25/tonne from two weeks ago, according to IM\u2019s assessment on 27 July.\n\n86% bauxite also rose to $380-390/tonne, up by an average of $35/",
            "tonne compared to a fortnight ago.\n\n87% bauxite gained an average of $30/tonne to $390-400/tonne, while 88% was assessed at $400-430/tonne, up from $400-420/tonne previously, both on an FOB Xingang basis.\n\nSupply for 87% and 88% bauxite remained tight and few transactions were heard over the past fortnight, according to traders and producers.\n\nCalcined bauxite production also continued to be impacted due to the ongoing strict environmental controls: authorities are clear that facilities that do not meet standards will cease to operate.\n\nRefractory-grade bauxite spot prices declined at the end of June as some production restarted and, due to the imminent shutdown of processing facilities in Tianjian, some sellers were selling below market level in order to clear stocks.\n\n5833\n\n5834\n\nMagMin 2017: Have China's environmental inspections changed the magnesia industry?\n\nBy Albert Li Published: Friday, 28 July 2017\n\nIM analyst Albert Li visited Chinese magnesia-producing city Dashqiao during MagMin 2017 to see the impact the environmental controls have had on the city.\n\nWidespread Chinese environmental inspections have caused large-scale production shutdowns, but smoke-free skies may have proved short lived, IM's field trips found.\n\nDelegates from MagMin 2017, which took place in China for the first time earlier this month, attended a field trip to Dashiqiao in July to see firsthand the impact of the changes on the magnesia-producing city.\n\n\"Look at the blue sky in Dashiqiao, \" a government official told IM, before asking him to take a photo. \"We never had this kind of blue sky before. Dashiqiao has over 600 magnesia companies and their contribution to local GDP is more than 44%. It was grey and the air was full of dust; even the green leaves were covered by dust.\"\n\n\"Now local residents are really happy and fully supportive about the environmental checks after all production stopped. This is not just about now, it\u2019s also about our children,\" the government official added.\n\nMagMin2017: Temporary blue sky in Dashiqiao near a chemical company on 4 July 2017 source: Albert Li, www.indmin.com\n\n\"When the environmental inspection team from the central government arrived, they put posters in every village near the factories, asking villagers to report pollution with a reward. The village chiefs even asked them to do the same, even if it\u2019s just for reward,\" he continued.\n\n\"In the past, local authorities may have turned a blind eye to villager reports; they didn\u2019t want to punish the pollution because this would affect the local government\u2019s tax revenues,\" he said. \"But now since the central government has a team here, no one can stand in between. This is why this time all production stopped and why this is called the most serious environmental inspection storm in China.\"\n\n5835\n\nPost inspection turnaround?\n\nHowever, when the central government's inspection team left, the local government allowed the restart of some production immediately, IM was told by local sources who cited the governments heavy reliance on the tax revenues from the magnesia industry as the reason.\n\nDuring the MagMin field trips, most producers in Dashiqiao were in production and dust and smoke was spreading once more.\n\n\"IM should take the smoking chimney picture as your magazine\u2019s cover to show readers how the environmental inspection storm has changed the industry \u2013 nothing seems to have changed,\" one delegate told IM during the field trip.\n\nMagMin2017: Smoke and dust could be seen in Dashiqiao again on 12 July\n\nsource: Albert Li, www.indmin.com\n\nWaiting game\n\nWhile brick companies may be forced to start using natural gas instead of coal following the crackdown, many magnesia companies are still using coal because fundamental technology has not developed well enough, IM was told.\n\n\"New equipment is being used for desulfurition and denitration. But the question is, when will the unified standard come out, and when it comes, will there be another large-scale production stop?\"an official from the local association commented to IM.\n\nEven the most advanced DBM kiln still uses coal as a source material. source: www.indmin.com\n\nIn the weeks since MagMin2017 Chinese prices, tracked by IM, have continued to rise with market participants reporting ongoing tightness in supply.\n\nTo read more articles from Industrial Minerals' 2017 MagMin China event see the links below:\n\nMagMin 2017: Magnesite resource consolidation would be 'devastating' for industry\n\nMagMin 2017: Magnesia vs Fluorspar MagMin 2017: Dynamite ban"

            "\nBasis of Presentation\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related to financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, pension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the sale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business customers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated managed services for our large enterprise and government customers. We account for these revenues under Topic 606.\n\n59\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), captive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest recognized when equipment is sold to the customer by an authorized agent under a device payment plan agreement.\n\nNature of Products and Services\n\nTelecommunications\n\nService\n\nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an output method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our performance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a contract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage represents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month-to-month basis).\n\nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month in advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is rendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While substantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not fixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs.\n\nEquipment\n\nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of equipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a service contract: fixed-term plans (for our Business customers) and device payment plans.\n\nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering into a fixed- term service contract (typically for a term of 36 months or less).\n\nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid by the customer, typically over a 36-month term, and concurrently enters into a month-to-month contract for wireless service. We may offer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The credits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are recognized when earned.\n\nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which occurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of the device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-term and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These considerations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing in the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current facts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our"

In addition, any transfer of interests in an AUD Note, which is held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg will, to the extent such transfer will be recorded on the Austraclear System, be subject to the Corporations Act 2001 of Australia (the \u201cCorporations Act\u201d) and the rules and regulations of the Austraclear System. Furthermore, for the issue and transfer of any AUD Note within Australia, the aggregate consideration payable must be at least A$500,000 (or its equivalent in an alternative currency and, in either case, disregarding moneys lent by the offeror or its associate) or such issue and transfer must not otherwise require disclosure to investors under Parts 6D.2 or 7.9 of the Corporations Act.

With the development of 5G technologies, wireless service providers are increasingly focusing their marketing efforts on network quality, speed, and coverage, which are important for customer satisfaction.

            " transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication services. In addition, DISH Network Corporation has committed to deploy a facilities-based 5G broadband network in each of its license areas capable of serving at least 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023, which could result in additional competitive pressures in the U.S. wireless industry.\n\nWe also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers' voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. In addition, we expect to see increasing competition in the provisioning of internet access by low Earth orbit satellite companies as well in the area of fixed wireless offerings that provide an alternative to traditional landline internet service providers.\n\nWith respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, internet service providers, over-the-top (OTT) providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. We also face increasing competition from other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal providers. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. Several major cable operators offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Traditional wireless carriers are also bundling broadband internet offerings with wireless services while increasing their broadband internet footprint. Customers have an increasing number of choices for obtaining video content from various online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We also expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative.\n\nWe believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry:\n\n\n\nNetwork reliability, speed, capacity and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. With the development of 5G technologies, wireless service providers are increasingly focusing their marketing efforts on network quality, speed and coverage, sometimes directly targeting customers of Verizon. In addition, lower prices, improved service quality and new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage.\n\n\n\nPricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an increasingly important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers as well as retaining existing customers. Pricing also plays an important role in the wireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as IP Networking, Core Voice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge, new entrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nusing competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues.\n\n\n\nCustomer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to- use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn.\n\nCustomer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business customers through service representatives and online support, as well as through store- based representatives for small business customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives.\n\n\n\nProduct differentiation. Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services"

While the target hedge ratio varies depending on the funded status of the plan and the level of interest rates, the target hedge ratio was 60% at December 31, 2024, limiting volatility.\n\nThe annual measurement date for both our pension and other postretirement benefits is December 31. We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. The full yield curve approach refines our estimate of interest cost by applying the individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These individual spot rates align with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments and therefore provide a more precise estimate of interest cost.\n\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nOur current and deferred income taxes and associated valuation allowances are impacted by events and transactions arising in the normal course of business as well as in connection with the adoption of new accounting standards, changes in tax laws and rates, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and non-recurring items. As a global commercial enterprise, our income tax rate and the classification of income taxes can be affected by many factors, including estimates of the timing and realization of deferred income tax assets and the timing and amount of income tax payments. We account for tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in accordance with the accounting standard relating to the uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We review and adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on our best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at each reporting date. To the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact income tax expense and actual tax payments. We recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Actual tax payments may materially differ from estimated liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws as well as unanticipated transactions impacting related income tax balances. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n\nOur Property, plant and equipment balance represents a significant component of our consolidated assets. We record property, plant and equipment at cost. We depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. The estimated useful life is subject to change due to a variety of factors such as change in asset capacity or\n\n47\n\nTable of Contents\n\nperformance, technical obsolescence, market expectations and competitive impacts. In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment during 2024, we determined that the estimated useful life of our property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We expect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2024 depreciation expense of $2.4 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately $3.6 billion in our 2024 depreciation expense.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost less an allowance for credit losses that are not expected to be recovered. The gross amount of accounts receivable and corresponding allowance for credit losses are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets. We maintain allowances for credit losses resulting from the expected failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. We recognize the allowance for credit losses at inception and reassess quarterly based on management\u2019s expectation of the asset\u2019s collectability. The allowance is based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the credit quality of the customer base, the aging of such receivables and current macroeconomic conditions, as well as management\u2019s expectations of conditions in the future, as applicable. The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of estimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management\u2019s assessment of the collectability of assets pooled together with similar risk characteristics.\n\nWe record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement receivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is determined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer by customer basis and the custom credit scores are then"

These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\n\nOn September 30, 2022, we de-designated most of our cross-currency swaps from cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The amount remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges on the de-designation date was $1,857. The amount will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or when it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. The election of fair value hedge designation for cross-currency swaps does not have an impact on our financial results.\n\nUnrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.\n\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to \u201cInterest expense\u201d due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.\n\nCollateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At September 30, 2023, we had posted collateral of $689 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $1 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody\u2019s before the final collateral exchange in September, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $53. If AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P, and two levels by Moody\u2019s, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $4,642.

The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount.\n\nWe also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges.

They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\n\nUnrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.\n\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to \u201cInterest expense\u201d due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.\n\nCollateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At June 30, 2024, we had posted collateral of $680 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody\u2019s before the final collateral exchange in June, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $50. If AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P, and two levels by Moody\u2019s, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $3,594. At December 31, 2023, we had posted collateral of $670 (a deposit asset) and"

There is a clear contradiction now \u2013 I want this price level to continue when supply is tight, but when supply is not tight prices will fall.\"\n\nAnother issue is export advantages transferring to the domestic market, according to local sellers: \"Now foreign buyers can\u2019t get the goods in time like before, unless they have their own factories in China and can pay cash, like domestic buyers,\" one exporter in Dalian told IM.\n\n\"Even so, they can\u2019t be promised to get the volume in time. [The situation is much worse] for foreign buyers using LC payments.\"\n\nEurope\n\nThe market in Europe has meanwhile remained stable on existing price levels.\n\nLocal sources point to stockpiles of all magnesia grades present in Europe, which European suppliers and customers are now resorting to while China is short.\n\nPrices of European FM remain at $640-750/tonne FOB Europe, according to IM\u2019s 25 July assessment.\n\nAt least three suppliers active in Europe told IM they have no FM volumes available for sale, with another supplier of high-grade magnesia products saying he is \"fully booked\".\n\nOther European magnesia prices have remained unchanged. Calcined agricultural magnesia stands at \u20ac240-300/tonne CIF EU ports. Electrical-grade fused magnesia is priced at $1,500-2,450/tonne ex-works UK. Raw magnesite, max 3.5% SiO2 content, is also stable at \u20ac65-80/tonne FOB East Mediterranean.\n\nIn North America, electrical-grade fused magnesia is trading at $1,700-2,500/tonne ex-works US, while refractory-grade fused magnesia stands at $900-1,400/tonne FOB US.\n\n5832\n\nChinese bauxite prices increase on raw material shortage\n\nBy Yoke Wong Published: Friday, 28 July 2017\n\nReduced bauxite ore output in China has caused a supply shortage of raw material for the production of the calcined refractory mineral. This has pushed prices higher, as the ongoing anti-pollution measures are also supporting the market.\n\nSpot calcined bauxite prices increased amid rising raw material cost and supply shortage due to mining restrictions in China.\n\nThe use of dynamite was severely curtailed in the mining industry throughout China on environmental grounds since early this year and domestic bauxite mined output were reduced as a result.\n\nAlthough China is the world's largest importer of metallurgical-grade bauxite, this material is not suitable for calcining due to the low alumina and high iron content.\n\nCalcined bauxite producers in China mainly relied on domestic output in Shanxi and Guizhou provinces, where there are deposits of high-grade bauxite (70% Al2O3 and above) with low iron content. However, the bauxite deposits in China are mostly state-owned, with some estimating that more than 90% of the country\u2019s bauxite mine resources are in the hand of the Chinese government.\n\nMany calcined bauxite producers sourced raw material supply from Aluminium Corp of China Ltd (Chalco), one of the biggest aluminium producers in the country. But Chalco announced in mid-May that it had suspended approximately 970,000 tpa of alumina capacity across its refineries, according to IM\u2019s sister publication Metal Bulletin.\n\nAs a result of lower alumina capacity, less bauxite is required as feedstock for the refineries. Lower domestic bauxite availability has pushed the raw material prices upwards, with many sales requiring pre-payment, Chinese producers told IM.\n\nTwo Chinese producers cited bauxite ore prices as high as Chinese renminbi (Rmb) 1,500 ($222/tonne), up 15% from Rmb1,300 ($193/tonne) in June. Note: IM does not track or publish prices for bauxite ore.\n\nTo further compound supply issues, many processing plants in Tianjin were shut down due to violations to environmental norms, pushing all grades of calcined bauxite prices up over the past fortnight.\n\nSpot prices of 85% refractory-grade bauxite (85% Al2O3/2.0/3.15-3.2/0-6mm) increased to $360-370/tonne on an FOB Xingang basis, up an average of $25/tonne from two weeks ago, according to IM\u2019s assessment on 27 July.\n\n86% bauxite also rose to $380-390/tonne, up by an average of $35/",
            "tonne compared to a fortnight ago.\n\n87% bauxite gained an average of $30/tonne to $390-400/tonne, while 88% was assessed at $400-430/tonne, up from $400-420/tonne previously, both on an FOB Xingang basis.\n\nSupply for 87% and 88% bauxite remained tight and few transactions were heard over the past fortnight, according to traders and producers.\n\nCalcined bauxite production also continued to be impacted due to the ongoing strict environmental controls: authorities are clear that facilities that do not meet standards will cease to operate.\n\nRefractory-grade bauxite spot prices declined at the end of June as some production restarted and, due to the imminent shutdown of processing facilities in Tianjian, some sellers were selling below market level in order to clear stocks.\n\n5833\n\n5834\n\nMagMin 2017: Have China's environmental inspections changed the magnesia industry?\n\nBy Albert Li Published: Friday, 28 July 2017\n\nIM analyst Albert Li visited Chinese magnesia-producing city Dashqiao during MagMin 2017 to see the impact the environmental controls have had on the city.\n\nWidespread Chinese environmental inspections have caused large-scale production shutdowns, but smoke-free skies may have proved short lived, IM's field trips found.\n\nDelegates from MagMin 2017, which took place in China for the first time earlier this month, attended a field trip to Dashiqiao in July to see firsthand the impact of the changes on the magnesia-producing city.\n\n\"Look at the blue sky in Dashiqiao, \" a government official told IM, before asking him to take a photo. \"We never had this kind of blue sky before. Dashiqiao has over 600 magnesia companies and their contribution to local GDP is more than 44%. It was grey and the air was full of dust; even the green leaves were covered by dust.\"\n\n\"Now local residents are really happy and fully supportive about the environmental checks after all production stopped. This is not just about now, it\u2019s also about our children,\" the government official added.\n\nMagMin2017: Temporary blue sky in Dashiqiao near a chemical company on 4 July 2017 source: Albert Li, www.indmin.com\n\n\"When the environmental inspection team from the central government arrived, they put posters in every village near the factories, asking villagers to report pollution with a reward. The village chiefs even asked them to do the same, even if it\u2019s just for reward,\" he continued.\n\n\"In the past, local authorities may have turned a blind eye to villager reports; they didn\u2019t want to punish the pollution because this would affect the local government\u2019s tax revenues,\" he said. \"But now since the central government has a team here, no one can stand in between. This is why this time all production stopped and why this is called the most serious environmental inspection storm in China.\"\n\n5835\n\nPost inspection turnaround?\n\nHowever, when the central government's inspection team left, the local government allowed the restart of some production immediately, IM was told by local sources who cited the governments heavy reliance on the tax revenues from the magnesia industry as the reason.\n\nDuring the MagMin field trips, most producers in Dashiqiao were in production and dust and smoke was spreading once more.\n\n\"IM should take the smoking chimney picture as your magazine\u2019s cover to show readers how the environmental inspection storm has changed the industry \u2013 nothing seems to have changed,\" one delegate told IM during the field trip.\n\nMagMin2017: Smoke and dust could be seen in Dashiqiao again on 12 July\n\nsource: Albert Li, www.indmin.com\n\nWaiting game\n\nWhile brick companies may be forced to start using natural gas instead of coal following the crackdown, many magnesia companies are still using coal because fundamental technology has not developed well enough, IM was told.\n\n\"New equipment is being used for desulfurition and denitration. But the question is, when will the unified standard come out, and when it comes, will there be another large-scale production stop?\"an official from the local association commented to IM.\n\nEven the most advanced DBM kiln still uses coal as a source material. source: www.indmin.com\n\nIn the weeks since MagMin2017 Chinese prices, tracked by IM, have continued to rise with market participants reporting ongoing tightness in supply.\n\nTo read more articles from Industrial Minerals' 2017 MagMin China event see the links below:\n\nMagMin 2017: Magnesite resource consolidation would be 'devastating' for industry\n\nMagMin 2017: Magnesia vs Fluorspar MagMin 2017: Dynamite ban"

            " settled with the relinquished 39 GHz licenses. The remaining balance was settled in cash of $1.6 billion. In connection with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after-tax) was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the previously held licenses for new licenses had commercial substance.\n\nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with the rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which are estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing costs. During 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing costs, of which $1.4 billion were accrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet. We expect to continue to make payments related to clearing cost and incentive payment obligations through 2024, which we expect to be $4.8 billion. These payments are dependent on the incumbent license holders accelerated clearing of the spectrum for Verizon\u2019s use and, therefore, the final timing and amounts could differ based on the incumbent holders\u2019 execution of their clearing process. In accordance with the FCC order, the clearing must be completed by December 2025. The carrying value of the wireless spectrum won in Auction 107 consists of all payments required to participate and purchase licenses in the auction, including Verizon\u2019s allocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction that we are obligated to pay in order to acquire the licenses, as well as capitalized interest to the extent qualifying activities have occurred.\n\nIn March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon incurred costs associated with these agreements of approximately $340 million, of which $310 million was paid as of December 31, 2022. This early clearance accelerated Verizon's access to more spectrum in a number of key markets to support its fifth-generation (5G) network initiatives.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of an insignificant amount and $95 million, respectively. During 2021, we recognized a pre-tax loss in connection with the sale of certain wireless licenses of $223 million ($167 million after tax).\n\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\n\nTracFone Wireless, Inc.\n\nIn September 2020, we entered into a purchase agreement (TracFone Purchase Agreement) with Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil to acquire TracFone, a leading provider of prepaid and value mobile services in the U.S. The transaction closed on November 23, 2021 (the Acquisition Date). The acquisition positions Verizon as the leading prepaid, value and premium wireless carrier by expanding Verizon\u2019s portfolio, bringing enhanced access of our wireless network and comprehensive suite of mobility products and services to a new customer base.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the TracFone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of TracFone's outstanding stock in exchange for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, 57,596,544 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future cash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value of the common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $560 million and represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. See Note 9 for additional information. The contingent consideration payable is based on the achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn out period, as defined in the TracFone Purchase Agreement.\n\nIn May 2022, Verizon received net cash proceeds of $248 million for the final settlement of working capital, which was included in our consideration as of the Acquisition Date. During 2022, Verizon made payments of $188 million related to the contingent consideration, which is reflected in Cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. In January 2023, we made an additional payment of $102 million related to the contingent consideration. Contingent consideration payments are expected to continue through 2024.\n\n70\n\nTable of Contents\n"

            "2)\n\nThe revolving credit facility does not require us to comply with financial covenants or maintain specified credit ratings, and it permits us to borrow even if our business has incurred a material adverse change. The revolving credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit. As of March 31, 2023, there have been no drawings against the $9.5 billion revolving credit facility since its inception. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we drew down $515 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, from these facilities. Borrowings under certain of these facilities are amortized semi-annually in equal installments up to the applicable maturity dates. Maturities reflect maturity dates of principal amounts outstanding. Any amounts borrowed under these facilities and subsequently repaid cannot be reborrowed.\n\nOther, Net\n\nOther, net financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 includes $500 million in proceeds from a short-term revolving credit facility, $117 million in payments for settlement of cross currency swaps, and $102 million payment for TracFone contingent consideration.\n\nDividends\n\nAs in prior periods, dividend payments were a significant use of capital resources. We paid $2.7 billion in cash dividends during both the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nCovenants\n\nOur credit agreements contain covenants that are typical for large, investment grade companies. These covenants include requirements to pay interest and principal in a timely fashion, pay taxes, maintain insurance with responsible and reputable insurance companies, preserve our corporate existence, keep appropriate books and records of financial transactions, maintain our properties, provide financial and other reports to our lenders, limit pledging and disposition of assets and mergers and consolidations, and other similar covenants.\n\nWe and our consolidated subsidiaries are in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\n\nChange In Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\nOur Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2023 totaled $2.2 billion, a $371 million decrease compared to December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of the factors discussed above.\n\n45\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRestricted cash totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, primarily related to cash collections on certain receivables that are required at certain specified times to be placed into segregated accounts.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Free cash flow is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures (including capitalized software) from net cash provided by operating activities. We believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since capital expenditures are necessary for ongoing operations. Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on finance lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions or wireless licenses. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\n\nThree Months Ended\n\n(dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities Less Capital expenditures (including capitalized software) Free cash flow\n\n$\n\n$\n\n2023 8,289 $ 5,958 2,331 $\n\nMarch 31, 2022 6,821 $ 5,821 1,000 $\n\nThe increase in free cash flow during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to the similar period in 2022, is a reflection of the increase in operating cash flows, partially offset by the increase in capital expenditures, both of which are discussed above.\n\nOther Future Obligations\n\nAs of March 31, 2023, Verizon had 25 renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties. See Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. Under the REPAs, we plan to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 3.2 gigawatts of capacity across multiple states, including Arizona, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in investment, equity and commodity prices and changes in corporate tax rates. We employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps,"

        "question": "How do cross-currency swaps hedge cash flows against FX risk?",
        "ground_truth": "Cross-currency swaps hedge cash flows against FX risk by including initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.",
        "contexts": [
            " of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n\nUnrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges.\n\n21\n\n2022\n\n(411) (56)\n\n(355)\n\nAT&T INC. SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - Continued Dollars in millions except per share amounts\n\nCash Flow Hedging We designate some of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk generated from our foreign-denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\n\nOn September 30, 2022, we de-designated most of our cross-currency swaps from cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The amount remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges on the de-designation date was $1,857. The amount will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or when it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. The election of fair value hedge designation for cross-currency swaps does not have an impact on our financial results.\n\nUnrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.\n\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to \u201cInterest expense\u201d due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.\n\nCollateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At September 30, 2023, we had posted collateral of $689 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $1 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody\u2019s before the final collateral exchange in September, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $53. If AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P, and two levels by Moody\u2019s, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $4,642. At December 31, 2022, we had posted collateral of $886 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a",

We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.\n\nFair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount.\n\nWe also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n\nUnrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges.\n\n19\n\n2023\n\n165 1\n\n164\n\nAT&T INC.
