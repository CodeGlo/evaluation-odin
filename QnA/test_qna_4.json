ENGINEER'S POSITION\n\n6.1. The Engineer is in-principal agreement with the Contractor that, the change in\n\nspan length of the RF0-07 constituted a Variation and the Varied quantities\n\nshould be arrived by comparing the Final design/drawing [TD06] with the Base\n\nCase Design/Drawing.\n\n6.2. Further, the Engineer is of the opinion that the design philosophy for Base\n\nCase and revised scope shall be the same i.e., the Designs, Drawings and\n\nquantities of Base Case and revised scope of works [after Variation] are to be\n\narrived at using the Initial Pile Load Test results conducted post award of the\n\nContract.\n\n6.3. Since the Initial Load Test resulted in achievement of only 50% of the Design\n\nLoad, the Engineer opines that, the Contractor is required to use this reduced\n\nPile Load criteria to arrive both Base Case Design (i.e before the Variation in\n\nspan length) and Revised/Final Desi gn (after Variation in span length).\n\n6.4. Based on the above philosophy, the Engineer calculated the quantities of the\n\nupdated Base Case and arrived at the Variation quantity [Column D of Table\n\nin Page 2 of Letter No OCGC/43767 dated 13-Jan-21] Exhibit A-31/CD-3.\n\nSensitivity: LNT Const ruction Int ernal Use\n\n29\n\nCTP-15A DISPUTE 04 - REQUEST FOR DECISION\n\n7. CONTRACTOR'S POSITION\n\n7.1. The original scope of works at Bridge no 37/RF0-7, based on the Tender\n\nDrawing\n\nissued by the Employer\n\n[refer drawing no: CEG/SACHIN\n\nNADIAD/GAD-BRIDGE/S-4/37 in Part VI, Volume V (pg. 3886)], consisted\n\nof 1 X 48.Sm steel span + 1 X 13.4m concrete slab span configuration with\n\n2 No. of Piers and 2 No. of Abutments with 40 No. of piles and founding\n\nlevel at -34m\n\n7.2. Post award of contract, the scope of works at Bridge no 37/RF0-7 changed\n\nto 1 X 71.0m steel span + 1 X 17.6m concrete slab span configuration with\n\n2 No. of Piers and 2 No. of Abutments with 108 No. of piles and founding\n\nlevel at -34m.\n\n7.3. Both the Engineer and the Contractor agree that\n\n7.3.1 Such change in scope of works of Bridge no 37/RF0-7 is a Variation\n\nand the Contractor has to be compensated for the same.\n\n7.3.2 Also, such compensation is to be arrived based on the difference\n\nbetween the detailed design/d rawings of original structure (before\n\nVariation, i.e. Base Case Design) and revised structure (after\n\nVariation/ as per current design).\n\n7.4. However, the Contractor and the Engineer differ in their opinion on the\n\ndesign philosophy to be adopted for doing Base Case Design\n\n7.4.1 The Contractor opines that Base Case Design is to be arrived at by\n\nusing the Tender data provided by Employer himself [refer drawing\n\nno: CEG/SACHIN-NADIAD/GAD-BRIDGE/S-4/37 in Part VI, Volume\n\nV (pg. 3886)] at the time of the Bid .\n\n7.4.2 Whereas the Engineer opines that Base Case Design is to be arrived\n\nby using the results of Initial Pile Load Test [conducted 50 months\n\nafter the award of the Contract].\n\n7.5 The Contractor, to support his opinion, humbly puts forth the following points-\n\n7.5.1 The Contractor whil e pricing his bid , has pragmatically used the\n\nTender data provided by Employer\n\n[Ref:\n\nrefer drawing no:\n\nCEG/SACHIN-NADIAD/GAD-BRIDGE/S-4/37 in Part VI, Volume V\n\n(pg. 3886",
            ")] to design the Bridge no 37/RF0-7. It is pertinentto note\n\nthat, the Tender did not require the Bidder to do a,ri( coif e\\ p . ration\n\n1 \u00b7\u00b7~, I 1 :,~:, - \u00b7''\u00b7~~30 \\\u2022 O)t ,. ---\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7~'\\. ~ \"'\"SO R;,,./\n\n!\n\nSensitivity: LNT Construction Internal Use\n\nCTP-15A DISPUTE 04 - REQUEST FOR DECISION\n\nfor the purpose of confirmatory Borehole during the bid stage, also,\n\nthe clause 4.10 of GCC/PCC & ATB casts specific obligation on the\n\nEmployer to provide all the data available and limits the obligation of\n\nthe Contractor only to the extent of interpretation of data. The Contract\n\nunder Clause 15 of Section-8 Employer's Requirement General [pg\n\n212 of CA], states that the confirmatory borehole and further soil\n\nexploration are to be executed by the Contractor post award of the\n\nContract, during the detailed design stage.\n\n7.5.2\n\nIn general trade practise parlance, Base Case Design means, initial\n\ndesign complying to the original terms of the Contract. Hence, in\n\nline with the same, the Contractor had submitted the Base Case\n\nDesign vi de letter no I ISL T /2213 dated 1 O-Jan-19, wherein, the Base\n\nCase Design was calculated based on the data provided by the\n\nEmployer himself\n\n[Ref:\n\nrefer drawing no: CEG/SACHIN\n\nNADIAD/GAD-BRIDGE/S-4/37 in Part VI, Volume V (pg. 3886)]. Such\n\nan understanding for Base Case Design was agreed by the Engineer\n\nhimself which is proved by the fact that the proposal of the Contractor\n\n[Use of Tender data for Base Case Design] was accepted by the\n\nEngineer himself vide OCGC/29899 dated 28-0ct-19 [V0-3].\n\n7.5.3 However, while executing the Variation, due to unfavourable Test pile\n\nresults, for reasons not attributable to the Contractor as explained in\n\nPoint 4.33 above, the quantities of the said Bridge no 37/RF0-7\n\nincreased further. The Engineer, at this juncture, contradicts its own\n\nstand and concludes [vide OCGC/44109 dated 25-Jan-21] that the\n\nBase Case Design is to be arrived by using the results of Initial Pile\n\nLoad Test [conducted 50 months after the award of the Contract] [V0-\n\n3A]\n\n7.5.4 A comparison of the Contractor's Base Case Design, viz-a-viz V0-3\n\nand V0-3A is shown in Table 1 below for the ready-\n\nSensitivity: LNT Construction Internal Use\n\n31\n\nCTP-15A DISPUTE 04 - REQUEST FOR DECISION\n\nCompliance with Tender Data/Drawing\n\nEngineer's Base Engineer's Base\n\nSino\n\nParameters\n\nContractor's Base Case\n\nCase while determining V0-3\n\nCase while determining V0-3A\n\nOCGC/29899 dated 10-Jan-19 dated 28-0ct-19 dated 13-Jan-21 B\n\nllSLT/2213\n\nOCGC/43767\n\nc\n\nA\n\n1\n\nTender Data\n\n1.1 1.2 2 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 3 3.1 3.2\n\nTender Borehole data\n\nSafe load\n\nFoundation\n\nNo of Piles\n\nLength of Piles\n\nConcrete Qty of Pile Cap\n\nReinforcement Qty of Pile Cap\n\nSubstructure\n\nNo of Pier/Pier/ Abutment Cap\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\n3.3\n\nConcrete Qty of Pier/Pier Cap/ Abutment Reinforcement Qty of Pier/ Pier cap/Abutment cap\n\nYes\n\n'f es\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\n4 4.1 4.2\n\nSuperstructure\n\nSpan length of Truss\n\nWeight of Tru ss\n"
