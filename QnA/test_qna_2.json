        "ground_truth": "Some of the requirements that a financing institution may impose on a contract to make it eligible for financing include: prohibition from discrimination against the shipping companies of any one country, ensuring that the Contract is subject to a widely-accepted neutral law, provision for arbitration under recognised international rules and at a neutral location, giving the Contractor the right to suspend/terminate in the event of default under the financing arrangements, restricting the right to reject Plant, specifying the payments due in the event of termination, specifying that the Contract does not become effective until certain conditions precedent have been satisfied, including pre-disbursement conditions for the financing arrangements, and obliging the Employer to make payments from his own resources if, for any reason, the funds under the financing arrangements are insufficient to meet the payments due to the Contractor.",
        "contexts": [
            " Sub-Clause 14.9.\n\nSub-Clause 14.15\n\nCurrencies of Payment\n\nIf all payments are to be made in Local Currency, it must be named in the Letter of Tender, and only the first sentence of this Sub-Clause will apply. Alternatively, the Sub-Clause may then be replaced:\n\nEXAMPLE SUB-CLAUSE FOR A SINGLE CURRENCY CONTRACT\n\nThe currency of account shall be the Local Currency and all payments made in accordance with the Contract shall be in Local Currency. The Local Currency payments shall be fully convertible, except those for local costs. The percentage attributed to local costs shall be as stated in the Appendix to Tender.\n\nFinancing Arrangements\n\nFor major contracts in some markets, there may be a need to secure finance from entities such as aid agencies, development banks, export credit agencies, or other international financing institutions. If financing is to be procured from any of these sources, the Particular Conditions may need to incorporate its special requirements. The exact wording will depend on the relevant institution, so reference will need to be made to them to ascertain their requirements, and to seek approval of the draft tender documents.\n\nThese requirements may include tendering procedures which need to be adopted in order to render the eventual contract eligible for financing, and/or special Sub-Clauses which may need to be incorporated into the Particular Conditions. The following examples indicate some of the topics which the institution's requirements may cover:\n\n(a)\n\nprohibition from discrimination against the shipping companies of any one country;\n\n(b)\n\nensuring that the Contract is subject to a widely-accepted neutral law;\n\n(c)\n\nprovision for arbitration under recognised international rules and at a neutral location;\n\n(d)\n\ngiving the Contractor the right to suspend/terminate in the event of default under the financing arrangements;\n\n(e)\n\nrestricting the right to reject Plant;\n\n(f)\n\nspecifying the payments due in the event of termination;\n\n(g)\n\nspecifying that the Contract does not become effective until certain conditions precedent have been satisfied, including pre-disbursement conditions for the financing arrangements; and\n\n(h)\n\nobliging the Employer to make payments from his own resources if, for any reason, the funds under the financing arrangements are insufficient to meet the payments due to the Contractor, whether due to a default under the financing arrangements or otherwise.\n\nIn addition, the financing institution or bank may wish the Contract to include references to the financing arrangements, especially if funding from more than one source is to be arranged to\n\nexcept: example text between lines may be copied\n\n15\n\n16\n\nfinance different elements of supply. It is not unusual for the Particular Conditions to include special provisions identifying different categories of Plant and specifying the documents to be presented to the relevant financing institution to obtain payment. If the financing institution's requirements are not met, it may be difficult (or even impossible) to secure suitable financing for the project, and/or the institution may decline to provide finance for part or all of the Contract.\n\nHowever, where the financing is not tied to the export of goods and services from any particular country but is simply provided by commercial banks lending to the Employer, those banks may be concerned to ensure that the Contractor's rights are very restricted. These banks may wish the Contract to exclude any reference to the financing arrangements, and/or to restrict the Contractor's rights under Clause 16.\n\nFORM OF SUB-CLAUSE WHICH A FINANCING INSTITUTION MAY REQUIRE\n\nThe Accepted Contract Amount is made up as follows:\n\n(breakdown into items and/or into supply/delivery/etc)\n\nand shall be payable by the Employer to the Contractor as set out below.\n\n(a)\n\n% of the Accepted Contract Amount shall be payable by a direct payment from the Employer to the Contractor within 28 days of receipt by the Employer of the following documents:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\ncommercial invoice addressed to the Employer specifying the amount of the payment now due, advance payment security guarantee issued by Bank in the form annexed, performance security guarantee issued by in the form annexed, and Interim Payment Certificate confirming the payment due and specifying the amount.\n\nBank\n\n(b)\n\n% of the contract price for the supply of Plant shall be\n\npayable as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n% of the estimated contract value of the Plant supplied, by direct payment from the Employer to the Contractor on shipment of each item, against the following documents:\n\n(original) commercial invoice, (original) shipping documents, (original"

        "question": "What conditions must be met for a contractor to recover additional claim preparation costs according to the SCL Delay and Disruption Protocol, 2nd Edition, February 2017?",
        "ground_truth": "The Contractor should not be entitled to additional costs for the preparation of claim information, unless it can show that it has been put to additional cost as a result of the unreasonable actions or inactions of the CA in dealing with the Contractor's claim.",

            " applied for payment of the loss and/or expense. This will be subject to any notice requirements in the contract. In contracts where there are no certificates, the Protocol recommends that interest should start to run 30 days after the date the Contractor suffered the loss and/or expense.\n\nStatutory interest on debts\n\n1.8\n\nIn considering claims for prolongation costs (and any other monetary claims) the parties should be aware of the various statutory rights to interest that may be available to an adjudicator, judge or arbitrator should they not resolve their dispute. These statutory rights include the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, section 35A of the Senior Court Act 1981, section 49 of the Arbitration Act 1996 and the Judgments Act 1838.\n\n2. Head office overheads and profit\n\n2.1\n\nThis section applies to claims for compensation other than the valuation of variations on the basis of rates and prices in the bill of quantities or schedule of rates which include provision for head office overheads and profit.\n\n2.2 Where there is Employer Delay to Completion, a Contractor will often include a claim for the lost contribution to head office overheads and the lost opportunity to earn profit (either on the project the subject of the claim or on other projects). This is on the basis that its time-related resources have been prolonged on the project, rather than earning revenue (including, importantly, contribution to head office overheads and profit) on other projects from the contract completion date.\n\n2.3\n\nHead office overheads can be sub-divided into: \u2018dedicated overheads\u2019 which through careful record keeping can be attributed to the specific Employer Delay; and \u2018unabsorbed overheads\u2019 (such as rent and some salaries) which are incurred by a Contractor regardless of its volume of work. These costs, if demonstrated, may be recoverable under the contract or, alternatively, may be claimed as damages for a breach of contract.\n\n2.4\n\nRegarding the lost opportunity to earn profit, this is generally not recoverable under the standard forms. Instead, Contractors typically frame their claim for the lost opportunity to earn profit as a claim for damages for breach of contract. An appropriate rate may be arrived at from the Contractor\u2019s audited accounts for the three previous financial years closest to the Employer Risk Events for which audited accounts have been published. If the contract does in fact allow the recovery of a profit element in addition to any other compensation for delay to the project the subject of the claim, the amount of profit allowed should reflect the fact that there is no risk involved in the earning of that profit.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n55\n\n2.5\n\nUnless the terms of the contract say otherwise, a lost contribution to head office overheads is generally recoverable as a foreseeable loss resulting from prolongation. It may be more difficult for the Contractor to demonstrate that the lost opportunity to earn profit was a foreseeable loss.\n\n2.6\n\nBefore it can recover unabsorbed overheads and lost profit, the Contractor must be able to demonstrate that it has:\n\n(a)\n\nfailed to recover the overheads and earn the profit it could reasonably have expected during the period of prolongation; and\n\n(b)\n\nbeen unable to recover such overheads and earn such profit because its resources were tied up by Employer Risk Events.\n\n2.7\n\nIn order to succeed in such a claim, the Contractor must demonstrate that there was other revenue and profit earning work available which, in the absence of the Employer Delay, would have been secured by the Contractor.\n\n2.8\n\nThe Contractor should make all reasonable efforts to demonstrate through records the head office overheads that it has failed to recover and the profit it has been deprived of earning. If it is not otherwise feasible to quantify the unabsorbed overheads and lost profit, formulae may be used (with caution) to quantify unabsorbed overheads and lost profit once it has been successfully demonstrated that overheads have remained unabsorbed and there is a lost opportunity to earn profit as a result of an Employer Risk Event. The burden of proving that it has unabsorbed overheads and lost profit always rests with the Contractor. A formula just serves as a tool for the quantification of the loss (also see paragraph 1.28 regarding Core Principle 1 in Part B).\n\n2.9\n\nThe three most commonly used formulae are Hudson, Emden and Eichleay. They are set out in Appendix A.\n\n2.10 The use of the Hudson formula is not supported. This is because it is dependent on the adequacy or otherwise of the tender in question, and because the calculation is derived from a number which in itself contains an element",
            " of head office overheads and profit, so there is double counting.\n\n2.11\n\nIn the limited circumstances where a formula is to be used, the Protocol prefers the use of the Emden and Eichleay formulae. However, in relation to the Eichleay formula, if a significant proportion (more than, say, 10%) of the final contract valuation is made up of the value of variations, then it will be necessary to make an adjustment to the input into the formula, to take account of the fact that the variations themselves are likely to contain a contribution to head office overheads and profit.\n\n2.12 The CA or, in the event of a dispute, the person deciding the dispute, should not be absolutely bound by the results of a formula calculation. It is possible that the use of a particular formula will produce an anomalous result because of a particular input into it. It is suggested that the result of the use of one formula be cross-checked using another formula. A spreadsheet to do this is available on the Society website: https://www.scl.org.uk/resources/delay-disruption- protocol.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n56\n\n2.13 The tender allowance for head office overheads and profit may be used, if that\n\nis what the parties for convenience wish to do.\n\n3.\n\nClaim preparation costs\n\n3.1 Most construction contracts provide that the Contractor may only recover the cost, loss and/or expense it has actually incurred and that this be demonstrated or proved by documentary evidence. The Contractor should not be entitled to additional costs for the preparation of that information, unless it can show that it has been put to additional cost as a result of the unreasonable actions or inactions of the CA in dealing with the Contractor\u2019s claim. Similarly, unreasonable actions or inactions by the Contractor in prosecuting its claim should entitle the Employer to recover its costs. The Protocol may be used as a guide as to what is reasonable or unreasonable.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n57\n\n2nd edition of the Protocol\n\nThe work involved in reviewing the 1st edition and drafting the 2nd edition of the Protocol was carried out by the following individuals:\n\nKim Rosenberg (Chair) David Barry Richard Bayfield Chris Ennis Keith Kirkwood Marianne Ramey Jeremy Winter\n\nThanks also to The Honourable Mrs Justice O\u2019Farrell, Deepa Khandhia and Oliver Sangster for their contributions and support.\n\n1st edition of the Protocol\n\nMost of the work involved in drafting the 1st edition of the Protocol was carried out by the following individuals:\n\nJeremy Winter (Chair) Richard Bayfield Paul Brough Anthony Caletka Jonathan Douglas Peter Johnson Stuart Jordan Stuart Nash Keith Pickavance Jim Pragnell David Richards\n\nThanks also to the following for their contributions, comments and support:\n\nPaul Bennett John Burgess Mike Desmond Nigel Gamble Andrew Grantham Keith Kirkwood Jacqueline Mimms Walter Murphy Peter Shaw John Temprell Simon Wrightson Michael Blackburne Gerlando Butera John Dye Brian Gayton John Hammond\n\nJohn McGuiness Anthony Morgan Dan Octavian Michael Stokes Douglas Treacher Andrew Yendall John Burbidge John Crane Tony Elven Roger Gibson Paul Kelly Christopher Miers Brendan Murphy Greg Russell Kate Sullivan Dennis Wiles\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n58\n\nDrafts of the 1st and 2nd editions of the Protocol were reviewed and commented on by many individuals and organisations. Their comments were duly studied by the drafting committees and, where considered appropriate, have influenced the text. The drafting committees wish to record their respective appreciation of the time and effort devoted by all those who commented. The ultimate decision on the form and content of the document rests with the respective drafting committees.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n59\n\nAPPENDIX A Definitions and glossary\n\nThis Appendix provides explanations for words and expressions used in the Protocol.

Under the usual arrangements for this type of contract, the Contractor constructs the works in accordance with a design provided by the Employer. However, the works may include some elements of Contractor-designed civil, mechanical, electrical and/or construction works.\n\nConditions of Contract for Plant and Design-Build,\n\nwhich are recommended for the provision of electrical and/or mechanical plant, and for the design and execution of building or engineering works. Under the usual arrangements for this type of contract, the Contractor designs and provides, in accordance with the Employer\u2019s requirements, plant and/or other works; which may include any combination of civil, mechanical, electrical and/or construction works.\n\nConditions of Contract for EPC/Turnkey Projects,\n\nwhich may be suitable for the provision on a turnkey basis of a process or power plant, of a factory or similar facility, or of an infrastructure project or other type of development, where (i) a higher degree of certainty of final price and time is required, and (ii) the Contractor takes total responsibility for the design and execution of the project, with little involvement of the Employer. Under the usual arrangements for turnkey projects, the Contractor carries out all the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), providing a fully-equipped facility, ready for operation (at the \u201cturn of the key\u201d).\n\nShort Form of Contract,\n\nwhich is recommended for building or engineering works of relatively small capital value. Depending on the type of work and the circumstances, this form may also be suitable for contracts of greater value, particularly for relatively simple or repetitive work or work of short duration. Under the usual arrangements for this type of contract, the Contractor constructs the works in accordance with a design provided by the Employer or by his representative (if any), but this form may also be suitable for a contract which includes, or wholly comprises, Contractor-designed civil, mechanical, electrical and/or construction works.\n\nThe forms are recommended for general use where tenders are invited on an international basis. Modifications may be required in some jurisdictions, particularly if the Conditions are to be used on domestic contracts. FIDIC considers the official and authentic texts to be the versions in the English language.\n\nIn the preparation of these Conditions of Contract for Construction, it was recognised that, while there are many sub-clauses which will be generally applicable, there are some sub-clauses which must necessarily vary to take account of the circumstances\n\nrelevant to the particular contract. The sub-clauses which were considered to be applicable to many (but not all) contracts have been included in the General Conditions, in order to facilitate their incorporation into each contract.\n\nThe General Conditions and the Particular Conditions will together comprise the Conditions of Contract governing the rights and obligations of the parties. It will be necessary to prepare the Particular Conditions for each individual contract, and to take account of those sub-clauses in the General Conditions which mention the Particular Conditions.\n\nFor this publication, the General Conditions were prepared on the following basis:\n\n(i)\n\ninterim and final payments will be determined by measurement, applying the rates and prices in a Bill of Quantities;\n\n(ii)\n\nif the wording in the General Conditions necessitates further data, then (unless it is so descriptive that it"

        "question": "How can a Contractor show costs for delays from Employer Risks?",
        "ground_truth": "The Contractor must demonstrate that it has actually suffered loss and/or expense before it becomes entitled to compensation, unless the contract provides otherwise. Arguments about proof of loss could be reduced or avoided if the contract contained an agreed amount per day that can be applied to each day of prolongation.",
        "contexts": [
            ".5 Under other standard forms, prolongation compensation arising from variations is to be valued if possible as part of the variation at or on the basis of the rates\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n50\n\nand prices in the bill of quantities or schedule of rates, or on the basis of a fair valuation.\n\n19.6\n\nIt is not good practice to leave to be compensated separately at the end of the contract the prolongation and disruption element of a number of different variations and/or changes. This is likely to result in the Contractor presenting a global claim, which is a practice that is to be discouraged. Where it is not practicable to agree in advance the amounts for prolongation and disruption to be included in variations and sums for changed circumstances, then it is recommended that the parties to the contract do their best to agree the total amount payable as the consequence of the variations and/or changes separately as soon as possible after the variations are completed.\n\n19.7 Though some standard forms of contract have a provision that where a variation affects unvaried work, the affected unvaried work may be treated as varied, these provisions are rarely used. The use of these provisions is encouraged, in order to promote early agreement on the complete effect of the variation.\n\n20. Basis of calculation of compensation for prolongation\n\nUnless expressly provided for otherwise in the contract, compensation for prolongation should not be paid for anything other than work actually done, time actually taken up or loss and/or expense actually suffered. In other words, the compensation for prolongation caused other than by variations is based on the actual additional cost incurred by the Contractor. The objective is to put the Contractor in the same financial position it would have been if the Employer Risk Event had not occurred.\n\n20.1 Delay causes prolongation. Prolongation causes\n\nincreased cost. The recoverability of compensation for prolongation depends on the terms of the contract and the cause of the prolongation. Obviously, any prolongation costs resulting from Contractor Risk Events must be borne by the Contractor. Compensation for prolongation resulting from Employer Risk Events will primarily comprise the Contractor\u2019s extended use of time-related resources, notably its site overheads. It is, however, not possible to say that compensation for prolongation comprises exclusively additional time-related resources because other types of recoverable loss may result from Employer Risk Events.\n\n20.2 The recovery of prolongation compensation depends on the terms of the contract and the cause of the prolongation. Prolongation costs may be caused by any kind of Employer Risk Event \u2013 a variation, a breach of contract, or other identified provision in the contract \u2013 for example, unforeseen ground conditions.\n\n20.3 Whether the cause of the prolongation is governed by a provision in the contract or a breach of contract, it is up to the Contractor to demonstrate that it has to actually suffered compensation, unless the contract provides otherwise.\n\nloss and/or expense before\n\nit becomes entitled\n\n20.4 Arguments about proof of loss could be reduced or avoided altogether if the contract contained an agreed amount per day that can be applied to each day of prolongation. This is the reverse of the normal Employer\u2019s liquidated damages provision. It may be necessary to have a number of different agreed amounts to\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n51\n\nbe applied depending on the stage in the project where the delay occurs. One method of fixing the figure(s) would be for the Contractor to price a schedule of rates with indicative quantities at tender stage.\n\n20.5\n\nIf the prolongation is caused by a variation, then it is recommended that the compensation for prolongation should be agreed as soon as possible after completion of the variation and where practicable included in the valuation of the variation (see the guidance to Core Principle 19 in Part B).\n\n21. Relevance of tender allowances\n\nThe tender allowances have limited relevance to the evaluation of the cost of prolongation and disruption caused by breach of contract or any other cause that requires the evaluation of additional costs.\n\n21.1 For prolongation or disruption compensation based on actual cost or loss and/or expense, the tender allowances are not relevant because the Contractor is entitled to its actual costs of the prolongation or disruption.\n\n21.2\n\nIt is a common misunderstanding in the construction industry that if the Contractor has made no or inadequate allowance for site overheads in its tender, then that fact limits or removes its entitlement to compensation for prolongation and/or disruption where the basis of recovery is actual cost incurred. This is not correct. Under these circumstances recoverable compensation requires the ascertainment of the actual cost of remaining on site for the additional time. The tender allowances are therefore of little relevance to the ascertainment of compensation under these circumstances."

Figure 1 is showing how much\n\nyou have spent as with Planned Value, can be looked at in terms of cumulative and current.\n\nCumulative AC is the sum of the actual cost for activities performed to date.\n\n2.2.6 Current AC is the actual costs of activities performed during a given period. This period could\n\nrepresent days, weeks, months, etc. AC is also called Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).\n\nEarned Value\n\n2.2.7\n\nTo report the accomplishments of the project, one must apply Earned Value (EV) to the figures and\n\ncalculations in the project. EV is the quantification of the \u201cworth\u201d of the work done to date. In other\n\nwords, EV tells, in physical terms, what the project has accomplished as shown in figure 1 above.\n\n9\n\nKhurais Facilities Expansion & Satellite GOSP Project\n\nContract No. 1107073\n\n2.2.8\n\nAs with PV and AC, EV can be presented in a cumulative and current fashion. Cumulative EV is the\n\nsum of the budget for the activities accomplished to date. Current EV is the sum of the budget for\n\nthe activities accomplished in a given period. Earned Value is also called Budgeted Cost of Work\n\nPerformed (BCWP).\n\n2.2.9\n\nPlanned Value (PV) is determined by the cost and schedule baseline. Actual Cost (AC) is\n\ndetermined by the actual cost incurred on the project. Earned Value (EV) tells you, in physical terms,\n\nwhat the project accomplished.\n\n2.3\n\nVariance Analysis\n\n2.3.1\n\nPMI\u2019s PMBOK\u00ae Guide defines a variance as \u201ca quantifiable deviation, departure, or divergence\n\naway from a known baseline or expected value\u201d (PMI, 2004, p. 379). As the project planning\n\ncomponents become known, the scope and quality, schedule, and cost estimate. The project\n\nmanager will review with the project\u2019s sponsor or client to seek approval. When approval is granted\n\nthe project has established a planning baseline or time-phased cost plan. There are two basic\n\nexpressions of variance, schedule variance and cost variance.\n\nSchedule variance\n\n2.3.2\n\nSchedule Variance status does indicate the dollar value difference between work that is ahead or\n\nbehind the plan and reflects a given measurement method Schedule Variance status does not\n\naddress impact of work sequence, address importance of work, reflect critical path assessment,\n\nindicate amount of time it will slip, identify source (labour & material) of difference, indicate the\n\ntime ahead/behind (or regain) schedule, nor indicate the cost needed to regain schedule as\n\nshown in The formula utilized to express schedule variance is project earned value minus the project\n\nplanned value as of the date of examination. (SV = EV \u2013 PV) If the variance is equal to 0, the project\n\nis on schedule. If a negative variance is determined, the project is behind schedule and if the\n\nvariance is positive the project is ahead of schedule.\n\nCost Variance\n\n2.3.3\n\nThe cost variance is defined as the \u201cdifference between earned value and actual costs. (CV = EV\n\n\u2013 AC)\u201d (PMI, 2004, p. 357). Sometimes this formula is expressed as the difference between budgeted\n\ncost of work performed and actual cost work performed. If the variance is equal to zero (0), the\n\nproject is on budget. If a negative variance is determined, the project is over budget and if the\n\nvariance is positive the project is under budget as shown in Table 2. Refer to Table 3 for detailed\n\ninterpretation of Cost Variance.\n\n10\n\nKhurais Facilities Expansion & Satellite GOSP Project\n\nContract No. 1107073\n\nTable 2 - Earned Value formulae7 used for analysis\n\nPerformance Indices\n\n2.3.4\n\nAnother analysis that is done by using EVMS is that of Performance or establishing the project\u2019s burn\n\nrate.

The contract's wording on EOT clauses and float can influence these outcomes.",
        "contexts": [
            " for granting EOT\n\nSubject to the contract requirements, the EOT should be granted to the extent that the Employer Risk Event is reasonably predicted to prevent the works being completed by the then prevailing contract completion date. In general, this will be where the Employer Risk Event impacts the critical path of the works and thus extends the contract completion date. This assessment should be based upon an appropriate delay analysis, the conclusions derived from which must be sound from a common sense perspective. The goal of the EOT procedure is the ascertainment of the appropriate contractual entitlement to an EOT; the analysis should not start from a position of considering whether the Contractor needs an EOT in order not to be liable for liquidated damages.\n\n5.1\n\nIf the CA does not make a determination of the EOT entitlement resulting from an Employer Risk Event when an EOT is in fact due, there is a danger that the EOT mechanism may fail, leaving the Contractor only obliged to finish the works within a reasonable time, having regard to the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the contract (with the uncertainty which that creates). For this reason, construction contracts should contain provisions entitling the CA on its own initiative to determine an EOT, even if the Contractor has not applied for one, or has applied with insufficient information.\n\n5.2\n\nA properly drafted EOT clause will contain general wording to allow an EOT to be granted in respect of acts (or omissions) of prevention or breach of contract by the Employer. Such wording is needed because the English courts have held that wording such as \u2018any other special circumstances\u2019 does not cover breaches by the Employer. Such an EOT clause should also explain the consequences of the Contractor\u2019s failure to comply with any procedural requirements in applying for an EOT.\n\n5.3\n\nGenerally, an EOT should be granted to the extent that the Employer Risk Event is predicted to prevent the works being completed by the then prevailing\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n26\n\ncontract completion date. This process requires consideration of whether the Employer Risk Event impacts the critical path and thus extends the contract completion date (see guidance to Core Principle 8 in Part B).\n\n6.\n\nEffect of delay\n\nFor an EOT to be granted, it is not necessary for the Employer Risk Event already to have begun to affect the Contractor\u2019s progress with the works, or for the effect of the Employer Risk Event to have ended.\n\n6.1\n\nAs explained in the guidance to Core Principle 4 in Part B, the practice of some CAs of waiting to see what the full effect an Employer Risk Event has on the works before dealing with the Contractor\u2019s application for EOT is discouraged. If the Contractor is entitled to an EOT it should receive it, and the CA should not wait to see if the Contractor actually needs the EOT, in order not to be liable for liquidated damages.\n\n7.\n\nIncremental review of EOT\n\nWhere the full effect of an Employer Risk Event cannot be predicted with certainty at the time of initial assessment by the CA, the CA should grant an EOT for the then predictable effect. The EOT should be considered by the CA at intervals as the actual impact of the Employer Risk Event unfolds and the EOT increased (but not decreased, unless there are express contract terms permitting this) if appropriate.\n\n7.1\n\nCAs should bear in mind that it is permissible to deal with EOT incrementally. The Protocol\u2019s recommended procedure for assessing EOT during the course of the project is set out in the guidance to Core Principle 4 in Part B.\n\n7.2\n\nThe CA should not, however, use an incremental approach to \u2018wait and see\u2019 the outcome of an Employer Risk Event as that would contravene Core Principle 4. Rather, the CA should grant an EOT for the then predictable effect of the Employer Risk Event. That then allows the Contractor to reprogramme the works to completion.\n\n8.\n\nFloat as it relates to time\n\nFloat values in a programme are an indication of the relative criticality of activities and, generally, when float is exhausted, the completion date will be impacted. Unless there is express provision to the contrary in the contract, where there is remaining total float in the programme at the time of an Employer Risk Event, an EOT should only be granted to the extent that the Employer Delay is predicted to reduce to below zero the total float on the critical path affected by the Employer Delay to Completion (i.e. if the Employer Delay is predicted to extend the critical path to completion).\n\n8.1\n\nFloat is the amount of time by which an activity or group of activities may be shifted",
            " in time without causing Delay to Completion. Activities with the least float are generally considered to be on the critical path of the works. Appendix A explains the different types of float. The date in question may be a sectional completion date, the overall completion of the works or an interim milestone.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n27\n\nThe \u2018ownership\u2019 of float causes particular arguments in disputes over entitlement to an EOT. A Contractor may argue that it \u2018owns\u2019 the float, because, in planning how it proposes to carry out the works, it has allowed additional or float time to give itself some flexibility in the event that it is not able to carry out the works as quickly as it planned. If, therefore, there is any delay to the Contractor\u2019s progress for which the Contractor is not responsible, it may contend that it is entitled to an EOT, even if the delay to progress will not result in the contract completion date being missed, but merely in erosion of its float. On the other hand, an Employer may typically say that the Contractor has no EOT entitlement unless the delay to progress will result in a contract completion date being missed. So (the Employer may say) the project owns the float.\n\n8.2\n\nParties should ensure that this issue is addressed in their contracts. The expression \u2018float\u2019 rarely, if ever, appears in standard form conditions of contract. Where the wording of the EOT clause in a contract is such that an EOT is only to be granted if the Employer Delay delays completion beyond the contract completion date, then the likely effect of that wording is that total float has to be used up before an EOT will be due. If the wording of the EOT clause is such that an EOT will be due whenever the Employer Delay makes the Contractor\u2019s planned completion date later than it would have been if it were not for that delay, then total float will probably not be available for the benefit of the Employer in the event of Employer Delay. Some conditions of contract give no indication as to whether an Employer Delay has to affect the contract completion date or merely the Contractor\u2019s planned completion date before an EOT is due.\n\n8.3\n\nIt is important that, when entering the contract, the parties appreciate the practical effects of the permutations described above. Under contracts where the Employer Delay has to affect the contract completion date, if an Employer Delay occurs first and uses up all the total float, then the Contractor can find itself in delay and paying liquidated damages as a result of a subsequent Contractor Delay which would not have been critical if the Employer Delay had not occurred first. Under contracts where the Employer Delay only has to affect the Contractor\u2019s planned completion date, the Contractor is potentially entitled to an EOT every time the Employer or CA delays any of its activities, irrespective of their criticality to meeting the contract completion date. Under the type of contract that is silent or ambiguous about float, uncertainty exists and disputes are likely to follow.\n\n8.4 Many conditions of contract have a provision that allows a final review of any EOT granted or not granted, reflecting what is perceived to be fair or reasonable. But reliance on what a CA perceives to be fair or reasonable is not always a good recipe for certainty. Where EOTs are granted retrospectively, it is possible to review separately the effect of different types of delay and make decisions on EOT entitlement, again based on fairness or reasonableness. But it is a very important principle of this Protocol that applications for EOT should be made and dealt with as close in time to the delay event that gives rise to them, and the \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach is discouraged (see the guidance to Core Principle 4 in Part B).\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n28\n\n8.5\n\nCore Principle 8 (and 9) set out the Protocol\u2019s position on float where the parties in their contract have not made clear provision for how float should be dealt with. This is consistent with current judicial thinking, which is that an Employer Delay has to be critical (to meeting the contract completion date) before an EOT will be due. It has the effect that float is not time for the exclusive use or benefit of either the Employer or the Contractor (unless there is an express provision in the contract).\n\n8.6\n\nIt follows from this approach that a Contractor has no entitlement to an EOT merely because an Employer Risk Event prevents the Contractor from completing the works earlier than the contract completion date or because an Employer Delay to Progress takes away the Contractor\u2019s float on any particular activity (unless there is an express provision in the contract).\n\n8.7\n"

        "ground_truth": "Concurrent delays impact cost recovery for contractors by requiring them to separate the additional costs caused by Employer Delay from those caused by Contractor Delay. The Contractor may not recover compensation in respect of the Employer Risk Event unless it can separate the loss and/or expense that flows from the Employer Risk Event from that which flows from the Contractor Risk Event. In most cases, the Contractor will be entitled to compensation only for any period by which the Employer Delay exceeds the duration of the Contractor Delay.

        "contexts": [
            " the Contractor Delay. If it would have incurred the additional costs in any event as a result of Contractor Delay, the Contractor will not be entitled to recover those additional costs.\n\n14.1 As it is in relation to EOT, concurrency is one of the most contentious issues in the determination of recoverable prolongation compensation. Contention arises when the Employer would be liable to compensate the Contractor for being kept on site longer than expected, but the Contractor was late in carrying out the works of its own, and so would have been late completing the works anyway. Should the Employer be obliged to compensate the Contractor in these circumstances?\n\n14.2 Answering this question does not always prove difficult in practice. The prolongation compensation will be recoverable if the Contractor can prove that its losses result from the Employer Delay. Proper analysis of the facts may reveal the true cause without argument.\n\n14.3 Where an Employer Delay to Completion and a Contractor Delay to Completion are concurrent, the Contractor may not recover compensation in respect of the Employer Risk Event unless it can separate the loss and/or expense that flows from the Employer Risk Event from that which flows from the Contractor Risk Event. If it would have incurred the additional costs in any event as a result of concurrent Contractor Delay, the Contractor will not be entitled to recover those additional costs. In most cases this will mean that the Contractor will be entitled to compensation only for any period by which the Employer Delay exceeds the duration of the Contractor Delay.\n\n14.4 The loss and/or expense flowing from an Employer Delay cannot usually be distinguished from that flowing from Contractor Delay without the following:\n\n(a)\n\nan as-planned programme showing how the Contractor reasonably intended to carry out the works and the as-planned critical path;\n\n(b)\n\nan as-built programme demonstrating the works and sequence actually carried out and the as-built critical path;\n\n(c)\n\nthe identification of activities and periods of time that were not part of the original scope;\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n39\n\n(d)\n\nthe identification of those activities and periods of time that were not part of the original scope and that are also at the Contractor\u2019s risk as to cost; and\n\n(e)\n\nthe identification of costs attributable to the two preceding sub-sections.\n\n14.5 This analysis should be co-ordinated with any analysis carried out by the Contractor to establish its rights to an EOT, while remembering that the entitlement to an EOT and the entitlement to compensation may not be co- extensive.\n\n15. Mitigation of delay and mitigation of loss\n\nThe Contractor has a general duty to mitigate the effect on its works of Employer Risk Events. Subject to express contract wording or agreement to the contrary, the duty to mitigate does not extend to requiring the Contractor to add extra resources or to work outside its planned working hours.\n\n15.1 Note that the requirement in the UK Joint Contracts Tribunal (JCT) contracts for the Contractor to use \u2018best endeavours\u2019 to prevent delay in the progress of the works and prevent completion of the works being delayed beyond the completion date may place a higher burden on the Contractor than the normal duty to mitigate. In the event of Employer Delay, it is of course open to the Employer to agree to pay the Contractor for measures, which go above and beyond the Contractor\u2019s general duty to mitigate. See the remainder of the guidance to Core Principle 15 below regarding mitigation of loss.\n\n15.2 A Contractor may consider pacing activities that are not on the critical path (i.e. slowing down non-critical activities so that they proceed at the same relative pace as the delayed activities on the critical path). The Protocol recommends that if the Contractor intends to pace non-critical activities, then it should notify the Employer and the CA of its intention in this regard, along with its reasons for doing so.\n\nThe Contractor\u2019s duty to mitigate its loss has two aspects: first, the Contractor must take reasonable steps to minimise its loss; and secondly, the Contractor must not take unreasonable steps that increase its loss.\n\n15.3 The Contractor should do all it reasonably can to avoid the financial\n\nconsequences of Employer Delay.\n\n15.4 Most construction contracts include a requirement to the effect that the Contractor must do all it can to avoid, overcome or reduce delay. Some forms actually make compliance with such provisions a condition precedent to the recovery of compensation or relief from liquidated damages.\n\n15.5 The limitations on the Contractor\u2019s obligations to mitigate Employer Delay are set out in this guidance to Core Principle 15. The Contractor",
            " EOT, then it is also automatically entitled to be compensated for the additional time that it has taken to complete the contract.\n\n12.2 Under the common standard forms of contract, the Contractor is nearly always required to claim its entitlement to an EOT under one provision of the contract and its entitlement to compensation for that prolongation under another provision. Further, some kinds of delay events which are at the risk of the Employer so far as time for completion is concerned carry no entitlement to compensation for prolongation; delay resulting from adverse weather conditions being the most common example. They are sometimes misleadingly called \u2018neutral events\u2019; in fact, they are only neutral in the sense that one party bears the time risk and the other party bears the cost risk. The Protocol calls them \u2018non-compensable Employer Risk Events\u2019. There is thus no absolute linkage\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n37\n\nbetween entitlement to an EOT and the entitlement to compensation for the additional time spent on completing the contract.\n\n12.3\n\nIf the method used to assess the amount of an EOT is prospective, i.e. based on the likely Employer Delay to Completion, and the method used to assess time for prolongation compensation is retrospective, i.e. is based on the loss and/or expense actually incurred, then the two assessments of time may produce different results. This is only to be expected, and does not necessarily indicate errors in either method.\n\n13. Early completion as it relates to compensation\n\nIf as a result of an Employer Delay, the Contractor is prevented from completing the works by the Contractor\u2019s planned completion date (being a date earlier than the contract completion date), the Contractor should in principle be entitled to be paid the costs directly caused by the Employer Delay, notwithstanding that there is no delay to the contract completion date (and therefore no entitlement to an EOT). However, this outcome will ensue only if at the time they enter into the contract, the Employer is aware of the Contractor\u2019s intention to complete the works prior to the contract completion date, and that intention is realistic and achievable.\n\n13.1\n\nIt is important to understand the significance of the statement above, and to contrast it with the position taken in the Protocol on the effect of total float on EOT (see Core Principle 8). In relation to EOT, the Protocol takes the position that an Employer Delay should not result in an EOT unless it is predicted to delay the activities on the longest path to completion. When it comes to compensation, the Protocol considers that, unless there is agreement to the contrary, the Contractor should be entitled to compensation for the delay, even if the delay does not result in an EOT. As with the effect of float on entitlement to EOT, the Protocol recommends that contracting parties expressly address this issue in their contract. They should ask themselves the question: if the Contractor is prevented by the Employer from completing on a date earlier than the contract completion date, should it have a remedy? If so, in precisely what circumstances? If not, then the contract should say so expressly.\n\n13.2 Where the parties have not addressed this issue in their contract, for the Contractor to have a valid claim, the Employer must be aware at the time the contract is entered into of the Contractor\u2019s intention to complete prior to the contract completion date. It is not permissible for the Contractor, after the contract has been entered into, to state that it intends to complete early, and claim additional costs for being prevented from doing so.\n\n13.3\n\nIt is recognised that the Protocol\u2019s position on this issue might be thought to conflict with at least one first instance English court decision. Nevertheless, the Protocol considers that, as a matter of policy, contractors ought not to be discouraged from planning to achieve early completion, because of the price advantage that being able to complete early is likely to have for the Employer. But the potential for conflict reinforces why the issue should be addressed directly in every contract.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n38\n\n13.4 The recoverable compensation in the situation described in this guidance to Core Principle 20 will normally only comprise the increased costs of the time- related resources directly affected by the Employer Delay to Progress. Recovery of such compensation will also be subject to considerations of concurrency, as described in the guidance to Core Principle 14 in Part B.\n\n14. Concurrent delay \u2013 effect on entitlement to compensation for prolongation\n\nWhere Employer Delay to Completion and Contractor Delay to Completion are concurrent and, as a result of that delay the Contractor incurs additional costs, then the Contractor should only recover compensation if it is able to separate the additional costs caused by the Employer Delay from those caused by"

        "ground_truth": "Site issues and contractor delays affected the SPI and forecasts for B34/B35 in Khurais by causing the works to remain behind the target completion date. For B34, constraints such as site clearance, lack of site readiness, site instructions, field design changes, delay in free issue material/equipment, and adverse climate conditions were mentioned. For B35, delays were due to the contractor's delay in delivery of free issue materials, prefabrication, installation of material/equipment, and late site access. These issues led to excusable delays, affecting the forecast completion dates and causing the SPI to fluctuate, with values mostly above one for B35 during the acceleration period.",

        "ground_truth": "An EOT (Extension of Time) helps the Contractor by relieving them of liability for damages for delay (usually liquidated damages) for any period prior to the extended contract completion date and allows for reprogramming of the works to completion. For the Employer, it establishes a new contract completion date, prevents time for completion of the works becoming 'at large', and allows for coordination and planning of its own activities.",

            " attempt to reach agreement. If they do not agree, the CA\u2019s view should prevail (unless and until it is reviewed and replaced under the contract dispute resolution procedures), and the CA\u2019s view on progress should be reflected in the Updated Programmes. The Contractor\u2019s position on the areas of disagreement should be recorded and submitted with the Updated Programmes.\n\n1.61 From time to time, the Contractor may wish to revise its plan for carrying out the remainder of the works. If rolling wave programming is utilised, subsequently detailing later summary activities is not a revision to the Contractor\u2019s plan.\n\n1.62 Specifically, the Contractor should attempt to reasonably revise its planned logic, sequence, and activity durations for the remainder of the works whenever there is or may be Contractor Delay to Completion or variations so as to ensure the contract completion date will be achieved. The contract should contain\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n21\n\nprovisions allowing the CA to require the Contractor to produce a proposed revised programme in such circumstances. These revisions should be made to the most recent Updated Programme (or the Accepted Programme if no Updated Programme has yet been produced).\n\n1.63 The Contractor should notify the CA of any proposed revisions and provide an electronic copy of the proposed revised programme, together with any consequential revision to the Contractor\u2019s method statements and a programme narrative that reflects the proposed revised programme. The CA should review and if appropriate accept the proposed revised programme. Once a revised programme is accepted by the CA it replaces the former Accepted Programme as the tool for monitoring actual progress.\n\n1.64 Acceptance by the CA of such a proposed revised programme does not constitute acceptance or waiver of the Contractor Delay, and requiring the Contractor to propose measures to recover delay is not an instruction or a deemed instruction to accelerate the works at the Employer\u2019s cost. Acceptance merely acknowledges that the revised programme reasonably reflects the current situation and the Contractor\u2019s current intention to carry out the remainder of the works.\n\n2.\n\nPurpose of EOT\n\nThe benefit to the Contractor of an EOT is to relieve the Contractor of liability for damages for delay (usually LDs) for any period prior to the extended contract completion date and allows for reprogramming of the works to completion. The benefit of an EOT for the Employer is that it establishes a new contract completion date, prevents time for completion of the works becoming \u2018at large\u2019 and allows for coordination / planning of its own activities.\n\n2.1\n\nIt is often incorrectly thought that an entitlement to an EOT automatically carries with it an entitlement to compensation for prolongation costs during the period of the EOT. The main effect of an EOT is that the Contractor is relieved of its liability for liquidated damages during the period of the extension and is able to reprogramme its works to completion. Its entitlement to compensation is usually to be found in other provisions of the contract or at law. The benefit of an EOT for the Employer is that it establishes a new contract completion date, prevents time for completion of the works becoming \u2018at large\u2019 and allows for coordination / planning of its own activities, such as training operational staff.\n\n2.2\n\nIf the good practice promoted in the guidance to Core Principle 1 with regard to the keeping of records and preparation, acceptance and updating of programmes is followed, then the scope for factual disagreement about a claimed entitlement to an EOT will be reduced.\n\n3.\n\nContractual procedural requirements\n\nThe parties and the CA should comply with the contractual procedural requirements relating to notices, particulars, substantiation and assessment in relation to delay events.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n22\n\n3.1 Most if not all the standard forms of contract contain obligations on the part of the Contractor to give notice to the CA as soon as an Employer Risk Event occurs that the Contractor considers entitles it to an EOT. Some require notice of the occurrence of an Employer Risk Event irrespective of whether it is likely to affect the contract completion date (i.e. the latter of which the Protocol refers to as Employer Delay to Completion), and some require notice of all events that adversely affect progress irrespective of liability or consequence. In some standard forms these notices are expressed to be conditions precedent (i.e. pre- conditions) to entitlement.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Contractor should comply with the contractual procedural requirements relating to notices, particulars and substantiation in relation to delay events. However, whatever the contract says, the Contractor should give notice to the CA of any Employer Delays as soon as possible. The CA should also notify the Contractor as early as possible of any Employer Delays of which it is aware."

        "ground_truth": "An EOT might be granted without Contractor delay when there is an Employer Risk Event that affects the Contractor's progress with the works, even if the effect of the Employer Risk Event has not yet begun or ended.",
        "contexts": [
            "\nFor an EOT to be granted, it is not necessary for the Employer Risk Event already to have begun to affect the Contractor\u2019s progress with the works, or for the effect of the Employer Risk Event to have ended.\n\n7.\n\nIncremental review of EOT\n\nWhere the full effect of an Employer Risk Event cannot be predicted with certainty at the time of initial assessment by the CA, the CA should grant an EOT for the then predictable effect. The EOT should be considered by the CA at intervals as the actual impact of the Employer Risk Event unfolds and the EOT increased (but not decreased, unless there are express contract terms permitting this) if appropriate.\n\n8.\n\nFloat as it relates to time\n\nFloat values in a programme are an indication of the relative criticality of activities and, generally, when float is exhausted, the completion date will be impacted. Unless there is express provision to the contrary in the contract, where there is remaining total float in the programme at the time of an Employer Risk Event, an EOT should only be granted to the extent that the Employer Delay is predicted to reduce to below zero the total float on the critical path affected by the Employer Delay to Completion (i.e. if the Employer Delay is predicted to extend the critical path to completion).\n\n9.\n\nIdentification of float\n\nThe identification of float is greatly assisted where there is a properly prepared and regularly updated programme, the Accepted/Updated Programmes.\n\n10. Concurrent delay \u2013 effect on entitlement to EOT\n\nTrue concurrent delay is the occurrence of two or more delay events at the same time, one an Employer Risk Event, the other a Contractor Risk Event, and the effects of which are felt at the same time. For concurrent delay to exist, each of the Employer Risk Event and the Contractor Risk Event must be an effective cause of Delay to Completion (i.e. the delays must both affect the critical path). Where Contractor Delay to Completion occurs or has an effect concurrently with Employer Delay to Completion, the Contractor\u2019s concurrent delay should not reduce any EOT due.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n6\n\n11. Analysis time-distant from the delay event\n\nWhere an EOT application is assessed after completion of the works, or significantly after the effect of an Employer Risk Event, then the prospective analysis of delay referred to in the guidance to Core Principle 4 may no longer be appropriate.\n\n12. Link between EOT and compensation\n\nEntitlement to an EOT does not automatically lead to entitlement to compensation (and vice versa).\n\n13. Early completion as it relates to compensation\n\nIf as a result of an Employer Delay, the Contractor is prevented from completing the works by the Contractor\u2019s planned completion date (being a date earlier than the contract completion date), the Contractor should in principle be entitled to be paid the costs directly caused by the Employer Delay, notwithstanding that there is no delay to the contract completion date (and therefore no entitlement to an EOT). However, this outcome will ensue only if at the time they enter into the contract, the Employer is aware of the Contractor\u2019s intention to complete the works prior to the contract completion date, and that intention is realistic and achievable.\n\n14. Concurrent delay \u2013 effect on entitlement to compensation for prolongation\n\nWhere Employer Delay to Completion and Contractor Delay to Completion are concurrent and, as a result of that delay the Contractor incurs additional costs, then the Contractor should only recover compensation if it is able to separate the additional costs caused by the Employer Delay from those caused by the Contractor Delay. If it would have incurred the additional costs in any event as a result of Contractor Delay, the Contractor will not be entitled to recover those additional costs.\n\n15. Mitigation of delay and mitigation of loss\n\nThe Contractor has a general duty to mitigate the effect on its works of Employer Risk Events. Subject to express contract wording or agreement to the contrary, the duty to mitigate does not extend to requiring the Contractor to add extra resources or to work outside its planned working hours. The Contractor\u2019s duty to mitigate its loss has two aspects: first, the Contractor must take reasonable steps to minimise its loss; and secondly, the Contractor must not take unreasonable steps that increase its loss.\n\n16. Acceleration\n\nWhere the contract provides for acceleration, payment for the acceleration should be based on the terms of the contract. Where the contract does not provide for acceleration but the Contractor and the Employer agree that accelerative measures should be undertaken, the basis of payment should be agreed before the acceleration is commenced. Contracting parties should seek to agree on the records to be kept"

        "ground_truth": "A contractor can make a global claim due to intertwined disruptions in rare cases where it is impossible or impracticable to distinguish the financial consequences of various causes of compensation, making an accurate or reasonable allocation of the compensation claimed between several causative events unfeasible. Examples of disruption events include piecemeal site access different from that planned, out of sequence works, or design changes, which can lead to reduced productivity and secondary consequences like crowding of labour or stacking of trades.",
        "contexts": [
            " of records is set out in the guidance to Core Principle 1 in Part B.\n\n17.2\n\nIn what should only be rare cases where the financial consequences of the various causes of compensation are impossible or impracticable to distinguish, so that an accurate or reasonable allocation of the compensation claimed cannot be made between the several causative events, then in this rare situation it is acceptable to proceed in two stages: (a) quantify individually those items of the claim for which the causal link can be established between the Employer Risk Event and the resultant costs and/or loss claimed; and (b) claim compensation for the remainder as a composite whole.\n\n17.3 For the composite part of the claim (the global claim), the Contractor will nevertheless need to set out the details of the Employer Risk Events relied on and the compensation claimed with sufficient particularity so that the Employer knows the case that is being made against it. It is also advisable for the Contractor to accompany its claim with a statement as to the steps it has taken to try fully to particularise the causal link for each Employer Risk Event in its claim, and the reasons why this has proved impossible or impracticable. The Contractor will also need to demonstrate that it would not have incurred the costs or suffered the loss included in the composite claim in any event.\n\n17.4\n\nIn assessing a claim advanced on a global basis, the CA, adjudicator, judge or arbitrator is not obliged to dismiss it out of hand simply because of its global\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n42\n\nnature. Rather, they should consider whether, subject to any additional contractual restrictions or procedural requirements: (a) Employer Risk Events occurred which caused delay and/or disruption to the Contractor; and (b) such delay or disruption caused the Contractor to incur additional cost. However, it is not the responsibility of the CA, adjudicator, judge or arbitrator to identify such events and quantify their effect in circumstances where the Contractor has failed to do so.\n\n17.5 The Contractor must be aware that there is a risk that a global claim will fail entirely if any material part of the global loss can be shown to have been caused by a factor or factors for which the Employer bears no responsibility and it is not possible for the CA, adjudicator, judge or arbitrator to assess the value of that non-recoverable portion on the available evidence.\n\n17.6 The guidance in this section applies equally to claims pursued by any other\n\nproject participant (including a party making a counterclaim).\n\n18. Disruption claims\n\nCompensation may be recovered for disruption only to the extent that the contract permits or there is an available cause of action at law. The objective of a disruption analysis is to demonstrate the loss of productivity and hence additional loss and expense over and above that which would have been incurred were it not for the disruption events for which the Employer is responsible.\n\n18.1 Disruption (as distinct from delay) is a disturbance, hindrance or interruption to a Contractor\u2019s normal working methods, resulting in lower efficiency. Disruption claims relate to loss of productivity in the execution of particular work activities. Because of the disruption, these work activities are not able to be carried out as efficiently as reasonably planned (or as possible). The loss and expense resulting from that loss of productivity may be compensable where it was caused by disruption events for which the other party is contractually responsible.\n\n18.2 Disruption events can have a direct effect on the works by reducing productivity (such as piecemeal site access different from that planned, out of sequence works or design changes). They can also lead to secondary consequences on the execution of the works, for example through crowding of labour or stacking of trades, dilution of supervision through fragmented work gangs, excessive overtime (which can lead to fatigue), repeated learning cycles and poor morale of labour which can further reduce productivity.\n\n18.3 That lost productivity will result in financial loss in carrying out the impacted work activities. However, not all lost productivity is subject to compensation. The Contractor may recover compensation for disruption (whether under the contract or for breach of contract) only to the extent that the contract permits or there is an available cause of action at law.\n\n18.4 As regards a claim for disruption under the contract, most standard forms do not expressly address recovery for disruption, although they do address some of the specific events that could lead to disruption, such as unforeseen ground conditions and untimely approvals or instructions from the CA. Disruption is\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n43\n\nalso not a cause of action at law in its own right. The Contractor must therefore explain in its claim document the legal basis of its entitlement.\n\n18.5 When it comes to explaining the cause of disruption, it",
            " is often the case that the Contractor will rely upon multiple and intermingled disruption events to explain its loss of productivity and to support its claimed entitlement to loss and expense relating to the impacted work activities. Depending upon the circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable to identify the loss of productivity, and hence loss and expense, relating to individual disruption events. Hence, once the Contractor has excluded the costs and/or loss relating to specific Employer Risk Events for which the causal link can be established, the remaining disruption claim may present the rare situation in which it is acceptable to claim compensation as a composite whole (i.e. a global claim). The risks associated with proceeding with a global claim are explained in the guidance to Core Principle 17 in Part B.\n\nDisruption analysis\n\n18.6 Disruption is demonstrated by applying analytical methods and techniques to establish the loss of productivity arising out of the disruption events and the resulting financial loss. Disruption is not merely the difference between what actually happened and what the Contractor planned. From the Contractor\u2019s perspective, the objective of a disruption analysis is to demonstrate the lost productivity and hence additional loss and expense over and above that which would have been incurred were it not for the disruption events for which the Employer is responsible. Many of the causes of lower than anticipated productivity (such as poor supervision or planning, re-work due to defects, inadequate coordination of subcontractors, or over-optimistic tendering or tendering errors) will not justify compensation for disruption. It is only the consequences of disruption events that are the responsibility of the Employer for which compensation might be payable to the Contractor. The productivity loss caused by all other events must be excluded from the claim.\n\n18.7 The starting point of a disruption analysis is a review of productivity in carrying out the works over time in order to determine when lower productivity was achieved and what work activities were impacted. The analysis should then continue with development of an understanding of what works were carried out, when the works were carried out and what resources were used, followed by a review of the financial loss incurred. Maintaining accurate project records is therefore equally as important for a disruption analysis as it is for a delay analysis.\n\n18.8 The Protocol does not recommend the use of percentage additions to tender productivity assumptions, where these are unsupported by analysis. Where the Contractor has demonstrated disruption events for which the Employer is contractually responsible, even on very simple projects the Contractor should be capable of carrying out some analysis (albeit a limited analysis in the case of simple projects) in estimating the lost productivity and hence loss and expense caused by those disruption events. The onus of proof of the fact that disruption has led to financial loss remains with the Contractor.\n\nSCL Delay and Disruption Protocol 2nd Edition: February 2017\n\n44\n\n18.9 The Contractor seeking to be compensated for disruption must demonstrate the quantum of its claim to the level of certainty reasonably required by the CA, adjudicator, judge or arbitrator pursuant to the applicable law. That quantum is the cost of the productivity loss, which will be the difference between realistic and achievable productivity and that which was actually achieved in carrying out the impacted work activities as a result of the disruption events for which the Employer is responsible. Original tender assumptions should not automatically be considered as a \u2018realistic and achievable\u2019 baseline. As discussed further below, there are several methods of deriving a baseline against which to measure actual levels of productivity achieved as a result of the disruption events for which the Employer is responsible.\n\n18.10 It is recommended that compensation for disruption caused by variations be agreed in advance of carrying out the variations or, where this is not practicable, as soon as possible after completion of the variations (see the guidance to Core Principle 19 in Part B).\n\n18.11 It is recommended that disruption caused by other events for which the Employer is responsible are compensated by the actual reasonable costs incurred, plus a reasonable allowance for profit if allowed by the contract.\n\nMethods of disruption analysis\n\n18.12 There are several methods for the calculation of lost productivity resulting from disruption events, each with varying accuracy and general acceptance. A broad distinction may be made between those methods that rely on actual or theoretical measurements of comparative productivity (productivity-based methods), and those which rely on analysis of planned and actual expenditure of resource or costs (cost-based methods). The former seek to measure the loss of productivity in the utilised resources and then to price that loss; the latter seek more directly to ascertain the difference between actual cost and planned cost without first measuring productivity losses in the utilised resources.\n\n18.13 Set out below is an explanation of each of the following more common methods:\n\nProductivity-based methods\n\nCost-based methods\n\n1. Project-specific studies:\n\n1. Estimated v incurred labour\n\n(a) Measured mile analysis\n\n2. Estimated v used cost\n"
