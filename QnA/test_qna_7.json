It is fervently denied that no settlement has been reached between the Parties for reasons solely attributable to DLF Ltd. as alleged by you. In this regard, it is stated that no concrete proposals were put forward by you towards DLF's claims.

On 18 November 2020,167 the Contractor stated that \u201cI are in receipt of letter dated 7 November 2020, whereby you purport to terminate the captioned contract (\u2018Contract\u2019). At the outset, I state that purported termination is wrongful and contrary to the terms of Contract. The contents of your letter under reply are denied and nothing therein is to be deemed to be admitted for want of specific traverse\u201d. From the chronology listed above, I note that the Parties were in disagreement with respect to the pending works. Whilst DLF and the Engineer continuously highlighted the importance of closing out all pending works by Leighton as a pre-requisite to award CC, however Leighton remained adamant that the pending works are minor and the CC could be awarded without completing such pending works.\n\n307.\n\nTherefore, the works suffered delays and eventually the Contract was terminated by DLF on 7 November 2020.\n\n6.7.2 Delay measurement\n\n308. At the beginning of this window, the Project was in 10.6 months of critical delay.\n\n309.\n\nSince the Contract was terminated on 7 November 2020, I compare this date with the planned completion date of 3 September 2017.\n\n310.\n\nI calculate that 27.6 month168 of delay was between planned completion date and date of contract termination.\n\n311.\n\nTherefore, in summary the Project suffered 38.1 months of critical delay at the time of Contract termination.\n\n6.7.3 Cause(s) of delay in the window\n\n312. As noted above, IR submissions were prolonged in this window especially for T&C works and\n\nthen for snagging works at Tower A2 and C2.\n\n313. Additionally, the general lack of progress by Leighton due to the onset of a potential dispute between the Parties regarding work completion and subsequent issue for Completion Certificate, possibly held up the works.\n\n166 SOC Annexure Volume 4 Page 1511 167 Letter, L0052-11.20-LI-DLFL-4.2.1-AFA-svi 168 7 November 2020 minus 3 September 2017 = 38.1 months\n\nPrivileged and confidential Expert Report on Delay by Farhan Khan\n\nPage 65 of 68\n\nIn the matter of Arbitration \u2013 DLF Vs.

SIP approval has been put on hold since last\n\n03 months.\n\nForce Majeure Condition due to Coronavirus-COVID-19 as informed by letters being issued time to time.\n\n2.4 Assistance required from Employer / Engineer\n\n\uf06c\n\nTo ensure expeditious approval of New Marwar SIP after resolving Signalling arrangements for connecting lines with IR\u2019s Marwar Junction.\n\n\uf06c\n\nTo persuade CTP Contractor for timely provision of Station Service Building and yards. None of these is complete yet particularly in CTP-2 section i.e. from New Saradhana to New Shri Amirgarh Section and also beyond up to New Makarpura.\n\n\uf06c\n\nThe availability of OCC Building by CTP-3R Contractor at Ahmedabad is badly delayed. This will have impact on Project implementation in general and integrated testing of S&T Works in particular. Similarly, non-availability of Buildings in CTP-2 Section is a cause to worry. We request DFCCIL / Engineer to kindly intervene to get the OCC and SERs in CTP-3R as well as CTP-2 jurisdiction expedited.\n\n\uf06c We have also submitted proposal for Extension of Time (EOT) for MS2 vide letter STP5-GL-PMP-LTR-\n\nHIL-18-1492 dated 22.11.2018 with cut-off date of 31.10.2018 for 443 days.\n\nWe request Engineer to communicate approval for EOT for MS1 & MS2 at an early date.\n\n\uf06c We request DFCCIL and Engineer to appreciate timely availability of S&T Buildings & Yards and 230V Power Supply. There is an urgent need to impress on CTP & EMP-4 Contractors to fulfill the requirements of access and power supply as STP5 also needs time, thereafter, to progress the works. The delay in issuing CIP is a cause of Concern.\n\n\uf06c Review and Approval of TMS documents submitted. List document yet to review are approve are listed out and submitted the formal letter on 30-"

In the Contractor's letter dated 13 April 2023316, he highlighted that a transformer within the MLCP area premises was experiencing frequent sparks and fires, posing a serious safety risk to their workers. To prevent potential accidents, the Contractor requested that the Employer relocate the transformer outside the working premises.\n\n421. The Contractor thus faced significant delays and hindrances in the progress of the Multi-Level Car Parking (MLCP) Project due to various obstacles, including an existing electrical substation, trees, and offices within the Project area. Despite repeated requests and reminders from January 2021 onwards, these issues were not resolved promptly, leading to idle resources and halted work. The Contractor emphasized the need for 100% site clearance to proceed with heavy machinery mobilization and construction activities. It wasn't until 3 August 2022 that the substation was dismantled, and the site was finally cleared for work on 25 November 2022, allowing the Project to proceed.\n\n4.2.23.3.

On 28 September 2022321, the Contractor notified the Employer that \u201cWith reference to the above cited subject and referred letter, we have received the drawing and taken up the pedestrianization work at Maharaj Bada. Based on the study of the drawing, the design and the material used for pedestrianization work is suitable only for pedestrian purpose. But as per the current site condition, the site area is completely being used by vehicles which includes motor bikes, cars, and Heavy vehicles like Fire Engine. Hence, we request your good office to take necessary step to restrict the usage of light and heavy vehicles to avoid any damage for which L& T is not attributable since the design is only for pedestrian usage purpose. Photographs of current site condition is enclosed in Annexure A for your ready reference. An early action in the matter is requested.\u201d\n\n427.

            "or had to incur costs due to the operation and maintenance of the handed-over facilities and alleged that regular operation and maintenance are not within L&T's scope. The cost incurred under the operation and maintenance over the deployment of security guard, gardener, departmental workmen and other maintenance costs.\n\nFurther, the details of operation and maintenance costs are attached in Annexure H and the abstract of the same is presented in Table 21 below:\n\nS. Nr. Expense Description Claim amount (INR) 1 Security Guard 11,51,330 2 Gardener 1,74,432 3 Departmental Workmen 4,50,447 4 Other Maintenance costs 1,82,800 Total Claim amount (INR) 19,59,009\n\n Table 21: Operation & Maintenance cost\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the assessed claim amounts to INR 19,59,009 on account of operation and maintenance cost incurred by the Contractor.\n\nClaim 08: Head office Overheads\n\nIntroduction\n\nHead office overheads, also known as general and administrative (G&A) expenses, encompass the indirect costs incurred by a company's central operations. These expenses are vital for supporting the overall business activities and ensuring the smooth functioning of various departments within the organization. Understanding and managing head office overheads is crucial for maintaining financial health and operational efficiency.\n\nIn the construction industry, head office overheads typically include costs related to executive management, accounting, human resources, marketing, legal services, and other administrative functions that support the core project operations. Effective allocation and control of these overheads are essential for optimizing profitability and ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently across the enterprise.\n\nThe Contractor\u2019s Head Office Overheads (HOO) contribute to the income of the business as a whole and are normally recovered/ derived from the individual projects undertaken.\n\nDue to the prolongation of the Project duration without an increase in net income from the Project, the monthly income decreased, but on the other hand, the general running costs of the business (including Head Office costs) continued to be incurred in the same fashion till actual completion of the Project. This results in a direct loss to the Contractor.\n\nTherefore, the claim for such recovery of Head Office costs has arisen, as the Contractor failed to recover this part of overheads which could have been reasonably expected during the prolongation period; and has been unable to recover such overheads because its resources have been tied up by delays beyond the control of the Contractor.\n\nThe major types of costs incurred by the Contractor from HO Overhead are as follows:\n\nS. Nr. Construction Division Overheads 1 Employee Benefits Expense 2 Repairs Maintenance - Buildings (Elec. Installations and ICO) 3 Rent 4 Telephone Expenses - Others ICO 5 Power & Fuel 6 Professional fees 7 Travel - Inland Hotel Boarding & Lodging 8 Manpower Hire Charges 9 Cost of Software 10 Stationery & Printing 11 Bank Charges 12 Rates & Taxes 13 Repairs - other vehicles 14 Travel - Foreign Tickets 15 Advertising & Publicity 16 Other expenses A Total of Construction Division Overheads B Total of L&T Corporate Office's Overheads\n\nTable 22: HO Overhead cost-heads\n\nFurther, the SCL Delay & Disruption Protocol, which is a well-recognized international standard/ guidance protocol for the assessment of EOT and associated claims in construction Projects, states the following:\n\n\u201cHead office overheads are the incidental costs of running the Contractor\u2019s business as a whole and include indirect costs which cannot be directly allocated to production as opposed to direct costs which are the costs of production. Amongst other things, these overheads may include such things as rent, rates, directors\u2019 salaries, pension fund contributions and auditors\u2019 fees. In accountancy terms, head office overheads are generally referred to as administrative expenses, whereas the direct costs of production are referred to as costs of sales\u201d.\n\nThis sets out a well-established basis of the claim, whereby the Contractor seeks the losses which it has suffered as a result of not being able to take on other projects owing to the delays (not attributable to itself) and subsequent prolongation of the Contract, that loss being the loss of its opportunity to defray its Head Office Overhead Charges over those other projects.\n\nClaim amount and basis of calculation:\n\nBased on the delay analysis submitted vide the Contractor\u2019s latest EOT application, the Contractor is entitled to claim prolongation cost for 1186 days i.e. from the Project commencement date till the cut-off date of 31 March 2024.\n\n\n\nThe Contractor had calculated Head Office overheads based on the Emden Formula, as recommended in the Society of Construction Law, Delay and Disruption Protocol, 2nd Edition, February 2017 for the estimation of its lost contribution to its head office overheads.\n\nIn SCL Protocol 2017, the Emden Formula is defined",
            " as:\n\nThe cost incurred towards head office overheads had been arrived by referring to the HQ overheads for all the financial years during the course of the Project.\n\nThe head office overheads between the FY 2020-21 to 2022-23 are provided by L&T as presented in the Table 22 below:\n\nFinancial Year % Overhead 2020-21 3.97% 2021-22 3.58% 2022-23 3.48% 2023-24 3.48%\n\nTable 22: Head office overheads %\n\nFurther, the weighted average of the information provided in the above table has been calculated as per the Table 23 below:\n\nFinancial Year % Overhead (A) Total days (B) C = A*B Remarks 2020-21 3.97% 90 3.57 2021-22 3.58% 365 13.07 2022-23 3.48% 365 12.70 2023-24 3.48% 365 12.70 Considering previous financial year's data as 2023-2024 is not audited Total 1185 42.04 Weighted average (%) 3.55% = (42.04/1185) Financial Year % Overhead (A) Total days (B) C = A*B Remarks 2020-21 3.97% 90 3.57 2021-22 3.58% 365 13.07 2022-23 3.48% 365 12.70 2023-24 3.48% 365 12.70 Considering previous financial year's data as 2023-2024 is not audited Total 1185 42.04 Weighted average (%) 3.55% = (42.04/1185)\n\nTable 23: Weighted average of head office overheads\n\nBased on the overhead % arrived from the above calculation, the additional head office overhead costs incurred by the Contractor have been calculated in Annexure I and is presented in Table 24 below:\n\nAdditional Cost Incurred towards Head office Overheads during the Prolonged Period Description Value Remarks Original Contract value of the Project (INR) 2,99,95,90,000 a Weighted average % as per data 3.55% b Appointed date 01-Jan-21 c Planned completion date 30-Jun-22 d Original Contract period (in days) 546 e = (d - c + 1) Overhead Cost for Contractor for 546 Days (From 01-Jan-21 to 30-Jun-22) (INR) 10,64,25,959 f = a * b Overhead Cost for Contractor per day (INR) 1,94,919 g = f / e Analysis cut-off date 31-Mar-24 h Period of delay (in days) 640 i = (h - d) Total Claim amount (INR) 12,47,48,377 j = (i * g)\n\nTable 24: Additional cost incurred towards head office overheads\n\n\n\nThe Contractor\u2019s entitlement to Extension of Time for delay events till 31 March 2024 is 1186 days. In this submission, the Contractor has claimed the Loss of Head Office overhead cost for the prolonged period of 1186 days. Accordingly, the Contractor reserves the right to claim further additional cost on account of loss of head office overhead in future.\n\nTherefore, the assessed claim amounts to INR 12,47,48,377, representing the additional costs incurred due to head office overhead expenses during 640 days of excusable and compensable delays that were beyond the Contractor\u2019s control, as detailed in the Contractor\u2019s latest EOT Application.\n\n\n\nClaim 09: Loss of Opportunity & Profit\n\nIntroduction\n\nShould the project complete in the scheduled period, the Contractor would be closing the project with a profit margin as envisaged in the tender estimate. In the current scenario, its revenue target - which is dependent on the achieved progress of Works - is not met on a daily/ monthly level due to delays and disruption beyond the Contractor\u2019s control, whereas their daily/monthly expenses were being incurred as planned; therefore, Contractor is bearing the loss of planned profit, which is differential % of the Planned Revenue and Planned Expense.\n\nLoss of profit is a critical concern that can have far-reaching implications for contractors, developers, and stakeholders alike. This concept pertains to the financial losses incurred when projected profits from construction projects are not realized, typically due to delays, unforeseen expenses, or contractual disputes.\n\nLoss of profit in the construction industry is not merely a reflection of missed financial targets; it encapsulates a broader spectrum of challenges that can disrupt project timelines, strain resources, and undermine business viability. Factors contributing to such losses can be multifaceted, ranging from inefficient project management and labour shortages to supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions. Additionally, legal disputes over Contract terms or delays in payments can further exacerbate the financial strain.\n\nThe"
