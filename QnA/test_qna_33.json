For the Brown Field, the change in location of the tie-in and the subsequent requirement to change the routing from above ground to below ground led to the laying of underground piping, which was completed and signed off by 30 September 2021. For the Green Field, the relocation of the workshop required additional underground piping for road crossing, which was designed and completed.

The Contractor has been instructed by the Company to comply with the Company\u2019s directions in relation to installation of pressure gauges and Associated fitting in Main Gas line.\n\nChronology of Delay Event:\n\nDuring the engineering meeting held on 21 February 2021, the issue of requirement of tight shut off valve for Fuel gas and HC gas line was raised by the Company and Contractor informed that additional requirements are not necessary.\n\nDuring the execution stage, the Company instructed to install Pressure Gauges and associated fittings on the Main Gas and Pre-chamber line. The Contractor notified on 29 April 2021 vide ZPTE/OLNG/ LTR-229 that there will be time and cost implication for this change and there are reworks involved as well in addition to procurement of long lead items such as Equal Tee CS, Flange CS, Spool pipe CS, Mono flange and Pressure gauge.\n\nThe Contractor asserts that the Company approved design is technically complied and were discussed between all the Project stakeholders in many design workshops noted below:\n\nDesign review dated 19 June 2019\n\nHAZOP dated 18 August 2019\n\nModel Review dated 10 March 2020\n\nIPF dated 11 December 2019\n\nThe Company responded on 04 May 2021 vide 6A05/ OLNG/ ZPTE/ LTR/ 0241 that \u201cAll the non-compliances or deficiencies or omissions revealed at any stage during the execution of the CONTRACT shall be corrected by the Contractor at their cost. The Contractor is not in agreement with the Company\u2019s statement which in such instances renders the Contractor\u2019s entitlement under Clause 18 [Variations] redundant.\n\nAs the matter of installation of Pressure Gauges and Associated fitting in Main Gas line and Variation request was resolved on 20th November 2021.\n\nContractual Justification\n\nReferring to the Clause 18 of the GCC, which provides for Extension of the Time for completion of the work carried out by the Contractor; the Contractor\u2019s works were impacted by additional requirements of installation of pressure gauges and Associated fitting in Main Gas line. Therefore, the Contractor is considering the impact of permits on the work schedule and hereby submitting its entitlement to extension of time pursuant to the Clause 31.biz of the GCC.\n\n\n\nDE-37: Mobilization of Vendors\n\nDelay Period\n\nDelay Start Date \u2013 29th April 2021\n\nDelay Finish Date \u2013 30th June 2021\n\nTotal Duration- 63 Calendar days\n\nIntroduction of Delay Event:\n\nDue to the global pandemic COVID-19, Government issued regulations through Supreme Committee in order to control spread of COVID-19. The effect of COVID-19 has not ceased and restrictions imposed by the Supreme Committee from time to time has affected mobilisation of vendors. Further, complete travel ban from many countries to Oman are enforced which has caused delays to mobilization activities by various vendors and the Contractor\u2019s own resources as well.\n\nChronology of Delay Event:\n\nThis is in continuous with delay events under force majeure events claimed\n\nThe Contractor\u2019s progress of works was further impacted by restrictions on visa issuance by the Supreme Committee vide ZPTE/OLNG/LTR-220 dated 18 April 2021.\n\nFurther, the Subcontractor\u2019s vendors were unable to proceed for as-planned works after detection of COVID-19 positive cases for their staffs which were notified to the Company vide ZPTE/OLNG/LTR-231 dated 03 May 2021. Thus, the mobilization of vendors were affected and impacted the Contractor\u2019s progress against Rev-Q Programme. Some of the examples which were affected by above are presented below.\n\nEngine Hall Doors:\n\nThe Engine Hall Doors Were Delivered to site by 27 April 2021 for the installation and the Contractor\u2019s plan was to mobilize the vendor for installation on 5 May 2021. However, the mobilization of the vendor resources for the installation were delayed due to the detection of COVID cases. Despite of the efforts taken for the replacement of proposed resources, due to the spread of the Second wave the availability of resources was difficult. This had an impact on the progress of works for which the Contractor considers entitled for additional time.\n\nLube Oil Flushing\n\nThe Contractor would like to inform the Company that Lube Oil Vendor scheduled for mobilization on 25 April 2021 was rescheduled to 30 April 2021 due to the delay in delivery of level instruments because of COVID-19 at Supplier\u2019s warehouse facilities.  Again, the Mobilization was delayed due to the detection of COVID-19 case in",
            " the Subcontractor\u2019s crew. This had an impact on the progress of works for which the Contractor considers entitled for additional time.\n\nMonoplane valves\n\nThe Contractor has appointed TPI to expedite the progress, however the Delivery of alternate Seals to carryout retest is getting delayed because of COVID and also to note that the Manufacturer Facility in India is under lockdown since 10 April 2021 due to the local Government instructions. Since then, the testing and assembly is on hold. This is having an impact on the CCC and commencement of the commissioning activities.\n\nFAT - PACO System:\n\n\n\nThe Contractor further notified that ongoing DCS FAT in YMA at Bahrain is suspended since 03 May 2021 due COVID Case in the Facilities. Presently we understand from YME that, their facility will be under lockdown till 8th May 2021. \n\nAs event continued to affect the works critically until 30th June 2021.\n\nContractual Justification\n\nReferring to the Clause 19 of the GCC, which provides for Extension of the Time for completion of the work carried out by the Contractor; the Contractor\u2019s works were impacted by the COVID-19 Force Majeure event which was unforeseen and beyond the control of either party.\n\nTherefore, the Contractor is considering the impact of COVID-19 on the work schedule and hereby submitting its entitlement to extension of time pursuant to the Clause 31.biz of the GCC.\n\nDE-38: CP system Requirement at BF Service water Line\n\nDelay Period\n\nDelay Start Date \u2013 12th December 2021\n\nDelay Finish Date \u2013 31st August 2022\n\nTotal Duration- 263 Calendar days\n\nIntroduction of Delay Event:\n\nThis delay event pertains to the requirement of additional CP system at Brown Field and Green Filed for Service Air and Service water Line. On 05 December 2021, vide OLNG email, ZPTE was instructed to provide the CP for the underground piping when all construction and pre-commissioning works for these lines were completed as per the approval received from OLNG and moreover, all buried piping was coated with approved coating specifications. Therefore, the CP system Requirement at BF Service water Line constitutes variation to the Contract.\n\nChronology of Delay Event:\n\nBrown Field \u2013 Requirement of CP for Service Water Line\n\nAs per original design, the Tie\u2010in for Service water (Tie in 045-03) is located inside Train\u20103 service water distribution header. Accordingly, as per the original scope, the Isometric / PEFS drawings were prepared and approved.\n\nTo perform the Tie\u2010in as per the original design, Train 3 shutdown was required.   OLNG advised to change the tie location as OLNG was not able to provide the Train 3 Shutdown and mutually agreed to change the location of tie in. Accordingly, the TQ 755 was raised on 11 November 2020 and approved on 12 November 2020. This TQ was for change in location.\n\nAccording to the TQ 755, the piping ISO drawing was prepared for the above ground piping.\n\nDuring execution as per the above ISO, the joint visit was carried out by the EPC and PMC and during the joint visit it was found that, one of the existing pneumatic valves was fouling for Man access and advised to change the routing from above ground to below ground.\n\nAs per the instruction of the PMC, the TQ 773 raised on 21 Dec 2020 to change the above ground piping to below ground piping and approved on 3rd February 2021. This TQ clearly indicated the painting system for underground piping.\n\n\n\nUpon approval of the TQ the under-ground piping (12 m) was laid with PCS 5 and work was completed and CCC signed on 30 September 2021.\n\nThe MCC for the same was also completed and signed on 12 Dec 2021.\n\nAll piping work for the Brown Field works were completed as per the approved TQ. Accordingly, CCC and MCC were signed by the Company.\n\nThe Contractor on 25 April 2022 informed Company that Change in location in comparison to approved design was documented in Project change management system and the Contractor submitted DCN on 13 February 2022 that is pending the Company.\n\nGreen Field \u2013 Requirement of CP for Service Water and Service Air Line\n\nAs per the Original Design the workshop is located at North-west corner and the same is shown in plot plan Rev 4. As per the plot plan Rev 4 there is no requirement of the underground piping.\n\nThe Company commented to relocate the workshop towards the South East Corner and due to this there was an additional requirement of Road crossing, the Service Water (20M) and Service Air Line (20 M) piping which were designed underground.  Accordingly, piping drawings / ISO were prepared with PCS 05. Subsequently, painting and construction and installation completed."

No. Method of Analysis Analysis Type Critical Path Determined Delay Impact Determined Requires 1 Impacted As- Planned Analysis Cause & Effect Prospectively Prospectively Logic linked baseline programme. A selection of delay events to be modelled. 2 Time Impact Analysis Cause & Effect Contemporaneously Prospectively Logic linked baseline programme.

As-built programme. 6 Collapsed As- Built Analysis Cause & Effect Retrospectively Retrospectively Logic linked as-built programme. A selection of delay events to be modelled.\n\nBased on the availability of programmes, correspondence and documentary evidence, the Contractor is of the opinion that the Time Impact Analysis with Windows is the most appropriate method of delay analysis for this case. This methodology is a hybrid methodology i.e. mix of Time Impact Analysis and Time Slice Window Analysis.\n\nThis methodology requires certain conditions to be fulfilled in order to perform a delay analysis. Such conditions are fulfilled in this case:\n\nLogic linked baseline programme, which is available in this case\n\nUpdate programmes or progress information at monthly intervals with which to update the baseline programme, which are available in this case\n\nA selection of delay events to be modelled, also referred to as \u201cdelay fragnets\u201d; this has been done in this analysis\n\nTIME IMPACT ANALYIS (TIA) WITH WINDOWS PROCEDURE\n\nIn this case, as explained above, a Prospective as well as Retrospective analysis called \u2018Time Impact Analysis (TIA) With Windows\u2019 methodology, is adopted to calculate Contractor\u2019s entitlement to EOT.\u00a0 a reference is made to AACE Technical Paper 2018: CDR.2849 on Time Impact Analysis in Windows:\n\n\u201cTime Impact Analysis in Windows (TIA) is recognized as one of the most credible techniques for analyzing construction delays according to AACE MIP3.7 Recommended practice 29R-03. \n\n\n\nThis type of analysis was used to produce a concurrency analysis to prove contractor entitlement to prolongation costs.\u201d\n\nIt also states: \u201cThe TIA in Windows contains elements of retrospective analysis as the project schedule is reviewed in a series of \u2018snapshots\u2019 or \u2018time slices.\u2019 The analysis also contains a prospective analysis as the delays identified are swapped for an element of \u2018prospective\u2019 modelling. The analysis therefore combines a retrospective and prospective view and can be easily used to provide clear demonstration and calculation of concurrency and mitigation.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Time Impact Analysis (TIA) with Windows\u2019 approach consists of the following steps as explained in above AACE article:\n\nStep Description Details Step 1 Requirements to start the analysis, Arrangement of programmes, revisions of the baseline programme, progress updates, recovery, acceleration, mitigation programmes, etc. Details of delay events from Minutes of Progress Meetings, Monthly Reports, Progress presentations, variation orders Step 2 Preparation work, 2A Programmes Identification Review all programmes Baseline approved Update programmes exchanged i Identify the Baseline programme and ii Contemporaneous progress updates 2B Select the Window periods. Depending upon the data dates of available programme Depending on the type of project and the number of delay events 2C Selecting Critical and Near Critical Activities Identify the driving and sub-critical driving activities in each window, for the end of window programme. The driving activities need to be analyzed within the program for each milestone/section of the project that attracts liquidated damages. Step 3 Defining the Delay Events Delay Events are defined with start date and finish date, supported by the relevant correspondence or actual dates. The activities which were impacted by these delay events should be selected along with the corresponding relationship. Step 4 Modelling and Inserting",
            " the delay fragnets into the programme, Delay event fragnets (sub-network) were created to represent each of the verified relevant events, window-wise. The delay event fragnets developed were incorporated into the relevant windows (i.e. the window with the data date prior to the event initiation date) in chronological order. Step 5 Summarizing the results, Conclusion Summarizing and interpreting the findings of analysis\n\n\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF DELAY PERIOD: WINDOW-WISE\n\nAssessing Contractor\u2019s /Company\u2019s Delays\n\nThe extent to which each delay event impacted the planned progress (i.e. the effect of the delaying event), is analyzed by comparing the forecast completion Date prior to incorporating the delay events with the impacted Completion Date after the delay events have been incorporated.\n\nAssessing Contractor\u2019s Delays or Mitigations\n\nNow, comparing the impacted completion date (after incorporation of delay events) with the forecast completion date of the updated Programme, updated with progress data corresponding to end of the window.\n\nIf the date of actual completion of the Contract (or activity) is later than the calculated date of EOT entitlement, then it can be concluded that the Contractor had its own delays.\n\nHowever, in other words, if the date of actual completion of the Contract (or activity) is within the calculated date of EOT entitlement (or within the excusable delay duration), then it can be concluded that the Contractor had mitigated the delay effects.\n\nThe distribution of delay in a window described above is summarized in following table:\n\nS. No. Delay Distribution A Total Delay = Updated Date \u2013 Baseline Date = Company\u2019s Delays + Contractor\u2019s Delay B Company\u2019s = Impacted Date \u2013 Baseline Date = Entitlement of Contractor\u2019s EOT C Contractor\u2019s Delay or Contractor\u2019s Mitigation If C = A \u2013 B is positive Contractor\u2019s Delay = Total Delay \u2013Company\u2019s Delay = Entitlement of Company\u2019s Delay Penalties If C =B-A is positive Contractor\u2019s Mitigation = Company\u2019s Delay - Total Delay = Entitlement of Contractor\u2019s mitigation\n\nWINDOW-WISE ANALYSIS\n\nThe windows approach uses contemporaneous project documents, including project programmes and updates, to identify critical activities, as well as to measure the impact of delays in each window. The use of contemporaneous project information ensures that the analysis best reflects the parties\u2019 knowledge of the project\u2019s status at the time the delays occurred.\n\nSince, with each monthly window, the Programme used will be updated, the critical path for each window is also updated as the Works progress. Therefore, the impact of delay events over any window is measured on the latest critical path, and hence, the impact is calculated contemporaneously.\n\nThe project software will calculate/revise the critical path and estimated completion date after the actual progress of Works is input into the software.\n\nIn TIA with windows at monthly intervals, the effect of delay event(s) on the programmed (or updated) completion date is analyzed during the time slice, while comparing the completion dates, at the start and end of a time slice.\n\nA graphical illustration of Time Impact Analysis is shown below.\n\n\n\nThereafter, the Party\u2019s delay for entire period is calculated by summing up the individual delays of each of windows.\n\nParty\u2019s delay for entire period = Sum of Party\u2019s delays in all the considered windows\n\nThe reliability of the Approved Baseline Programme and its monthly updates are of paramount importance to the delay analysis as it is fundamental to calculating the effects of the events inserted into them during the process of a delay analysis.\n\nFor the purpose of accomplishment of this delay analysis, there were no changes made to the sanctity of the approved baseline programme or its update. However, as the Baseline Programme or its update is not very prospective to show the actual impact of the delay event, we elaborated the delay fragnet to show more reliable impact of the delay event.\n\n\n\nTHE AVAILABLE PROGRAMMES\n\nThe Baseline Programme\n\nThe approved \u2018Baseline Programme- REV D\u2019 is referred for the purpose of delay analysis. The referenced Baseline programme is suitable for all purposes and should be indicative of the planned intent for the Contractor\u2019s scope of the works.\n\nThe attributes of the baseline programme are shown below:\n\nTotal Activities...............................................2851\n\nNot Started....................................................2482\n\nIn Progress....................................................169\n\nCompleted.....................................................200\n\nRelationships.................................................8290\n\nActivities with Constraint\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...0\n\nCritical Activities\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.78\n\n"

Specifically, to what extent can the\n\nend user expect the process in question to perform safely and in the case of a failure,\n\nfail in a safe manner.\n\n3.\n\nFACILITIES UNDER SCOPE OF WORK\n\nSIL classification study shall be carried out for Hydrogen Generation Unit of IO CL,\n\nPa nipat Ref ine ry which is specified elsewhere in the bid document.\n\n4.\n\nSCOPE OF WORK\n\nContractor will provide an experienced Chairman and Scribe to undertake the SIL\n\nstudy. The SIL workshop will be carried out by a\n\nteam comprising of\n\nrepresentatives from all relevant project disciplines. The scope of the study includes\n\nall the identified Safety Instrumented Functions (SIFs) on the P&IDs and C&E\n\ndrawings. The CONTRACTOR shall prepare procedure for SIL classification study for\n\nUNITS / FACILITIES which shall comply with IEC 61511 / 61808 requirements and\n\nshall submit to OWNER/PMC for approval. Contractor shall submit CV for Chairman for\n\napproval prior to SIL workshop.\n\n5.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe most commonly used techniques for assigning target SIL\u2019s in the process industries\n\nare:\n\n\uf0a7 Consequence analysis\n\n\uf0a7 Modified HAZOP\n\nPage 1038 of 5693\n\nSAFETY INTEGRITY LEVEL STUDY GUIDELINES FOR HGU LEPC, IOCL PANIPAT REFINERY, BS VI\n\nA882-106-17-43-SIL-0001 Rev No.: 0 Page 4 of 8\n\n\uf0a7 Risk Matrix\n\n\uf0a7 Risk Graph\n\n\uf0a7 Quantitative Assessment\n\nCONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nThis methodology is the simplest but the most conservative. It evaluates the target SIL\u2019s\n\non the basis of the potential consequences of critical hazardous events. The likelihood\n\nof the event is not considered. The following is an example to illustrate how\n\nconsequence is correlated with SIL.\n\nSIL\n\nConsequence\n\n4\n\nPotential for fatalities offsite\n\n3\n\nPotential for multiple fatalities onsite\n\n2\n\nPotential for single fatality onsite or serious injuries\n\n1\n\nPotential for minor injuries\n\nMODIFIED HAZOP\n\nModifies HAZOP is an extension of the existing HAZOP procedure. The target SIL is\n\nassigned by a team based on the review of the potential risk identified in the HAZOP.\n\nIt requires a good understanding of process risk and the acceptable risk tolerance of\n\nthe company. As the assignment is very subjective, there needs to be some\n\nconsistency between the personnel on the SIL assignment team and",
            " the Process\n\nHazard Analysis (PHA) team.\n\nRISK MATRIX\n\nThis is one of the most commonly used techniques in the process industries to establish target\n\nSIL. It uses a risk matrix, which correlates risk severity and risk likelihood for the SIL. The\n\nmethod allows the consideration of both likelihood and severity of a potential hazardous\n\nevent during the assignment of SIL. By correlating SIL values with corporate developed risk\n\nmatrix, there is more consistency compared to the use of the Modified HAZOP methodology.\n\nUsing this method requires the evaluation of the existing layers of protection and their\n\nPage 1039 of 5693\n\nSAFETY INTEGRITY LEVEL STUDY GUIDELINES FOR HGU LEPC, IOCL PANIPAT REFINERY, BS VI\n\nA882-106-17-43-SIL-0001 Rev No.: 0 Page 5 of 8\n\neffects on the risks of the potential hazardous events.

This method\n\nfocuses on the evaluation of risk from the point of view of a person being exposed to\n\nthe incident impact zone. It is consequence driven and four parameters are used to\n\ncharacterize a potential hazardous event, Consequence (C), Frequency (F), Possibility\n\nof escape (P) and Likelihood of event (W).
