Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\n\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.\n\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.\n\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\n\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are\n\n31\n\nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\n\nAs announced on April 18, 2024, we further consolidated teams that focus on building AI models across Google Research and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. AI model development teams previously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are included as part of Google DeepMind, reported within Alphabet-level activities, prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\n\nOur operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\n\nThe following table presents information about our segments (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30,\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nRevenues:\n\nGoogle Services Google Cloud Other Bets Hedging gains (losses) Total revenues\n\n$\n\n$\n\n67,986 $ 8,411 297 (1) 76,693 $\n\n76,510 $ 11,353 388 17 88,268 $\n\n196,232 $ 23,896 870 86\n\n221,084 $\n\n220,836 31,274 1,248 191 253,549\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nOperating income (loss): Google Services Google Cloud Other Bets Alphabet-level activities\n\nTotal income from operations\n\n$\n\n$\n\n23,937 $ 266 (1,194) (1,666) 21,343 $\n\n30,856 $ 1,947 (1,116) (3,166) 28,521 $\n\n69,128 $ 852 (3,232) (6,152) 60,596 $\n\n88,427 4,019 (3,270) (7,758) 81,418\n"

            " to become the industry standard, our business could be seriously harmed. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products to\n\nmarket earlier than us, or if these products are more technologically capable than ours, our revenue could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur future growth depends on a number of video and broadband industry trends.\n\nTechnology, industry and regulatory trends and requirements may affect the growth of our business. These trends and requirements include the following:\n\n\n\nconvergence, whereby network operators bundle video, voice and data services to consumers, including mobile delivery options;\n\n\n\ncontinued strong consumer demand for streaming video services;\n\n\n\ncontinued adoption of public cloud SaaS platforms to stream video content to consumers, as well as for broadcast infrastructure workflows;\n\n\n\ncontinued growth in targeted advertising as a key revenue source for video streaming service providers;\n\n\n\nthe pace of adoption and deployment of high-bandwidth technology, such as DOCSIS 3.x, DOCSIS 4.0, next generation LTE and fiber-to-the-premises (\u201cFTTP\u201d);\n\n\n\nthe use of digital video by businesses, governments and educational institutions globally;\n\n\n\nefforts by regulators and governments in the United States and internationally to encourage the adoption of broadband and digital technologies, including 5G broadband networks, as well as to regulate broadband access and delivery;\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\u2022\n\nthe need to develop partnerships with other companies involved in video infrastructure workflow and broadband services;\n\n\u2022\n\nthe extent and nature of regulatory attitudes towards issues such as network neutrality, competition between operators, access by third parties to networks of other operators, local franchising requirements for telcos to offer video, and other new services, such as mobile video; and\n\n\n\nthe outcome of disputes and negotiations between content owners and service providers regarding rights of service providers to store and distribute recorded broadcast content, which outcomes may drive adoption of one technology over another in some cases.\n\nIf we fail to recognize and respond to these trends, by timely developing products, features and services required by these trends, we are likely to lose revenue opportunities and our operating\n\nresults, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur software-based broadband access product initiatives expose us to certain technology transition risks that may adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe believe our CableOS software-based broadband access solutions, supporting centralized, DAA or hybrid configurations, will significantly reduce broadband operator headend costs and increase operational efficiency, and are an important step in operators\u2019 transition to all-IP networks. If we are unsuccessful in continuing to innovate and develop and deploy our broadband access solutions in a timely manner, or are otherwise delayed in making our solutions available to our customers, our business may be adversely impacted, particularly if our competitors develop and market similar or superior products and solutions.\n\nWe believe our software-based broadband access solutions will continue to replace and make obsolete current CMTS solutions, which is a market our products have historically not addressed, as well as cable edge-QAM products. If demand for our software-based broadband access solutions is weaker than expected, our near and long-term operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Moreover, if competitors adapt new broadband industry technology standards into competing broadband access solutions faster than we do, or promulgate a new or competitive architecture for next-generation broadband access solutions that renders our CableOS solution obsolete, our business may be adversely impacted.\n\nThe sales cycle for our CableOS solutions tends to be long. For broadband operators, upgrading or expanding network infrastructure is complex and expensive, and investing in a CableOS solution is a significant strategic decision that may require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify. Potential customers need to ensure our CableOS solution will interoperate with the various components of its existing network infrastructure, including third-party equipment, servers and software. In addition, since we are a relatively new entrant into the CMTS market, we need to demonstrate significant performance, functionality and/or cost advantages with our CableOS solutions that outweigh customer switching costs. If sales cycles are significantly longer than anticipated or we are otherwise unsuccessful in growing our CableOS sales, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and, as a result, may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, causing our stock price to decline.\n\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future, on an annual and a quarterly basis, as a result of several factors, many of which are outside of\n\nour control. Some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n\n\n\nthe level and timing of spending of our customers in the United States, Europe and in other markets;\n\n\n\neconomic and financial conditions"

        "ground_truth": "Material Non-public Information is significant in relation to trading the Company's securities because possessing such information prohibits individuals from engaging in transactions until the information has been publicly disclosed for at least two Trading Days. This is to ensure compliance with securities laws and to prevent insider trading. Even during the Trading Window, individuals with access to Material Non-public Information should refrain from trading.",
        "contexts": [
            " shall be considered the first Trading Day following such public disclosure.\n\nThe safest period for trades involving Company's securities, assuming the absence of Material Non-public Information, is generally the first ten Trading Days of the Trading Window. Periods outside the Trading Window (i.e., the last month of each fiscal quarter and the period of time from the end of such quarter until the public disclosure of quarterly results) are particularly sensitive periods of time for transactions involving the Company's stock from the perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws (this restriction does not apply to transactions made under an approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan). This is due to the fact that officers, directors and certain other employees will, as any quarter progresses, be increasingly likely to possess Material Non-public Information about the expected financial results for the quarter.\n\nThe purpose behind the recommended Trading Window is to help establish a diligent effort to avoid any improper transactions. An Insider may choose not to follow this suggestion, but he or she should be particularly careful with respect to trading outside the Trading Window, since the Insider may, at such time,\n\nhave access to (or later be deemed to have had access to) Material Non-public Information regarding, among other things, the Company's anticipated financial performance for the quarter.\n\nIt should be noted that even during the Trading Window any person possessing Material Non-public Information concerning the Company should not engage in any transactions in the Company's securities until such information has been known publicly for at least two Trading Days (this restriction does not apply to transactions made under an approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan). Although the Company may from time to time recommend during a Trading Window that directors, officers, selected employees and others suspend trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public, each person is individually responsible at all times for compliance with the prohibitions against insider trading. Trades involving the Company's securities during the Trading Window should not be considered a \"safe harbor,\" and all directors, officers and other persons should use good judgment at all times.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may also require that directors, officers, selected employees and others suspend trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such event, such persons will be restricted from engaging in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of the Company's securities during such period, and will also be prohibited from disclosing to others the fact of such suspension of trading.\n\n2. Preclearance of Trades. The Board of Directors has determined that all officers and directors of the Company, and certain other employees designated by the Compliance Officer, should refrain from trading in the Company's securities, even during the Trading Window, without first complying with the Company's \"preclearance\" process. Each officer and director should contact the Company's Compliance Officer prior to initiating any purchase or sale of the Company's securities. The Company may also find it necessary, from time to time, to require compliance with the preclearance process from certain other Insiders. Although officers and directors wishing to trade pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan need not seek preclearance from the Company's Compliance Officer before each trade takes place, such persons must obtain the Compliance Officer's approval (or in the case of the Compliance Officer, the Chief Executive Officer's approval) of the proposed Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan before it is adopted.\n\n3. Individual Responsibility. Every officer, director and employee has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy regardless of whether the Company has recommended a trading window to that Insider or any other Insiders of the Company. The guidelines set forth in this Policy are guidelines only, and appropriate judgment should be exercised in connection with any trade in the Company's securities.\n\nAn Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company's securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the Material Non-public Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.\n\nApplicability of Policy to Material Non-public Information Regarding Other Companies\n\nThis Policy and the guidelines described herein also apply to Material Non-public Information relating to other companies, including the Company's customers, vendors or suppliers (\"business partners\"), when that information is obtained in the course of services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties, and termination of employment, may result from trading on Material Non-public Information regarding the Company's business partners. All employees should treat Material Non-public Information about the Company's business partners with the same care as is required with respect to information relating directly to the Company.\n\nDefinition of Material Non-public Information\n\nIt is not possible to define all categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would be considered important to an investor in making an investment decision regarding the purchase or sale of the Company's"

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non- GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\n\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects"

We may need to increase our existing compensation levels in certain markets or for certain roles in response to competition, rising inflation or labor shortages, which may increase our operating costs. Furthermore, a certain portion of our personnel in the United States is comprised of foreign nationals whose ability to work for us depends on obtaining the necessary visas. Our ability to hire and retain foreign nationals in the United States, and their ability to remain and work in the United States, is affected by various laws and regulations, including limitations on the availability of visas. Changes in U.S. laws or regulations affecting the availability of visas have, and may continue to adversely affect, our ability to hire or retain key personnel and as a result may impair our operations.\n\nOur products include third-party technology and intellectual property, and our inability to acquire new technologies or use third-party technology in the future could harm our business.\n\nIn order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products, we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing\n\nagreements with third parties. Although companies with technology useful to us are often willing to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with respect to such technology, we cannot provide assurances that such agreements may be negotiated on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The failure to enter, or a delay in entering, into such technology development or licensing agreements, when necessary or desirable, could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\nWe incorporate certain third-party technologies, including software programs, into our products, and, as noted, intend to utilize additional third-party\n\ntechnologies in the future. In addition, the technologies that we license may not operate properly or as specified, and we may not be able to secure alternatives in a timely manner, either of which could harm our business. We could face delays in product releases until alternative technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our products, if we are able to do so at all. These delays, or a failure to secure or develop adequate technology, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCybersecurity incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by disrupting our business operations, compromising our products and services, damaging our reputation or exposing us to liability.\n\nCyber criminals and hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security, misappropriate our proprietary information or cause business\n\ninterruptions. Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In the past, we have faced compromises to our network security, and companies are facing additional attacks as workforces have become more distributed as a result of remote and hybrid working arrangements stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. While we have invested in and continue to update our network security and cybersecurity infrastructure and systems, if our cybersecurity systems fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyber-attacks, phishing schemes, ransomware, data protection breaches, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n\n\n\nour intellectual property and other proprietary data, or financial assets, could be stolen;\n\n\n\nour ability to manage and conduct our business operations could be seriously disrupted;\n\n\n\ndefects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our product, software and SaaS offerings, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products; and\n\n\n\npersonally identifiable data of our customers, employees and business partners could be compromised.\n\nShould any of the above events occur, our reputation, competitive position and business could be significantly harmed, and we could be subject to\n\nclaims for liability from customers, third parties and governmental authorities.

The agreement allows us, from time to time, to sell certain eligible billed receivables in an aggregate outstanding amount of up to $30 million. In September 2024, we extended the agreement termination date to September 29, 2025.

While OFAC did not assess any penalties, the Cautionary Letter does not preclude OFAC from taking future enforcement actions if additional information warrants renewed attention. Furthermore, OFAC may consider our regulatory history, including this subpoena, our disclosures and the Cautionary Letter, if we are involved in future enforcement cases for failure to comply with export control laws and regulations. If we are found to have violated U.S. export control laws as a result of future investigations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws which could lead to penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise.\n\nIn addition, we may be subject to customs duties that could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results or, if we are able to pass on the\n\nrelated costs in any particular situation, would increase the cost of the related product to our customers. As a result, the future imposition of significant increases in the level of customs duties or the creation of import quotas on our products in Europe or in other jurisdictions, or any of the limitations on international sales described above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Further, some of our customers in Europe have been, or are being, audited by local governmental authorities regarding the tariff classifications used for importation of our products. Import duties and tariffs vary by country and a different tariff classification for any of our products may result in higher duties or tariffs, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and potentially increase the cost of the related products to our customers.\n\nOur business and industry are subject to various laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nOur business and industry are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws. For example, we are subject to environmental\n\nregulations such as the European Union\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) and Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cRoHS\u201d) directives and similar legislation enacted in other jurisdictions worldwide. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in such regions and countries. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they would likely result in additional costs, and could require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which, among other things, requires an annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. If we conclude in future periods that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation as of future year-ends, we may incur substantial additional costs in an effort to correct such problems, and investors may lose confidence in our financial statements, and our stock price may decrease in the short term, until we correct such problems, and perhaps in the long term, as well.\n\n45\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are subject to requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to conduct research,\n\ndisclose, and report whether or not our products contain certain conflict minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or its surrounding countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. In addition, we may incur certain additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free and/or we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\n\nChanges in telco legislation and regulations in the United States and other countries could affect our sales and the revenue we are able to derive from our products.

We draw upon our expertise in broadcast television, communications networking, compression technology and broadband access technologies to design, integrate and install complete solutions for our customers, including integration with third-party products and services. We offer a broad range of services, including SaaS-related support and deployment, program management, technical design and planning, building and site preparation, integration and equipment installation, end-to-end system testing and comprehensive training.\n\nCustomers\n\nWe sell our products to a variety of cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media companies.

Although\n\nwe continue to seek to broaden our customer base by penetrating new markets and further expanding internationally, we expect to see continuing industry consolidation and customer concentration.\n\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, Comcast accounted for 39%, 26% and 20% of our net revenue, respectively. The loss of any significant customer, or any material reduction in orders from any significant customer, or our failure to qualify our new products with any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we are involved in most quarters in one or more relatively large individual transactions. A decrease in the number of relatively larger individual transactions in which we are involved in any quarter could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nIn the United States and internationally, we sell our products through our own direct sales force, as well as through independent resellers and systems\n\nintegrators. Our direct sales team is organized geographically and by major customers and markets to support customer requirements. Our principal sales offices outside of the United States are located in Europe and Asia, and we have support staff in Switzerland and France to support our international customers and operations. Our international resellers are generally responsible for importing our products and providing certain installation, technical support and other services to customers in their territory after receiving training from us.\n\nOur direct sales force and resellers are supported by a highly trained technical staff, which includes application engineers who work closely with our\n\ncustomers to develop technical proposals and design systems to optimize system performance and economic benefits for our customers. Our technical support teams provide a customized set of services, as required, for ongoing maintenance, support-on-demand and training for our customers and resellers, both in our facilities and on-site.\n\nOur product management organization develops strategies for product lines and markets and, in conjunction with our sales force, identifies the evolving technical and application needs of customers so that our product development resources can be most effectively and efficiently deployed to meet anticipated product requirements.

        "question": "How does MNPI affect trading in/outside the Trading Window?",
        "ground_truth": "Material Non-public Information (MNPI) affects trading both inside and outside the Trading Window by imposing restrictions on transactions. Even during the Trading Window, any person possessing MNPI should not engage in transactions in the Company's securities until such information has been publicly known for at least two Trading Days. Outside the Trading Window, periods are particularly sensitive for transactions due to the likelihood of possessing MNPI about the Company's expected financial results. Insiders must be careful with trading outside the Trading Window as they may have access to MNPI.",
        "contexts": [
            " shall be considered the first Trading Day following such public disclosure.\n\nThe safest period for trades involving Company's securities, assuming the absence of Material Non-public Information, is generally the first ten Trading Days of the Trading Window. Periods outside the Trading Window (i.e., the last month of each fiscal quarter and the period of time from the end of such quarter until the public disclosure of quarterly results) are particularly sensitive periods of time for transactions involving the Company's stock from the perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws (this restriction does not apply to transactions made under an approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan). This is due to the fact that officers, directors and certain other employees will, as any quarter progresses, be increasingly likely to possess Material Non-public Information about the expected financial results for the quarter.\n\nThe purpose behind the recommended Trading Window is to help establish a diligent effort to avoid any improper transactions. An Insider may choose not to follow this suggestion, but he or she should be particularly careful with respect to trading outside the Trading Window, since the Insider may, at such time,\n\nhave access to (or later be deemed to have had access to) Material Non-public Information regarding, among other things, the Company's anticipated financial performance for the quarter.\n\nIt should be noted that even during the Trading Window any person possessing Material Non-public Information concerning the Company should not engage in any transactions in the Company's securities until such information has been known publicly for at least two Trading Days (this restriction does not apply to transactions made under an approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan). Although the Company may from time to time recommend during a Trading Window that directors, officers, selected employees and others suspend trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public, each person is individually responsible at all times for compliance with the prohibitions against insider trading. Trades involving the Company's securities during the Trading Window should not be considered a \"safe harbor,\" and all directors, officers and other persons should use good judgment at all times.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may also require that directors, officers, selected employees and others suspend trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such event, such persons will be restricted from engaging in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of the Company's securities during such period, and will also be prohibited from disclosing to others the fact of such suspension of trading.\n\n2. Preclearance of Trades. The Board of Directors has determined that all officers and directors of the Company, and certain other employees designated by the Compliance Officer, should refrain from trading in the Company's securities, even during the Trading Window, without first complying with the Company's \"preclearance\" process. Each officer and director should contact the Company's Compliance Officer prior to initiating any purchase or sale of the Company's securities. The Company may also find it necessary, from time to time, to require compliance with the preclearance process from certain other Insiders. Although officers and directors wishing to trade pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan need not seek preclearance from the Company's Compliance Officer before each trade takes place, such persons must obtain the Compliance Officer's approval (or in the case of the Compliance Officer, the Chief Executive Officer's approval) of the proposed Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan before it is adopted.\n\n3. Individual Responsibility. Every officer, director and employee has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy regardless of whether the Company has recommended a trading window to that Insider or any other Insiders of the Company. The guidelines set forth in this Policy are guidelines only, and appropriate judgment should be exercised in connection with any trade in the Company's securities.\n\nAn Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company's securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the Material Non-public Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.\n\nApplicability of Policy to Material Non-public Information Regarding Other Companies\n\nThis Policy and the guidelines described herein also apply to Material Non-public Information relating to other companies, including the Company's customers, vendors or suppliers (\"business partners\"), when that information is obtained in the course of services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties, and termination of employment, may result from trading on Material Non-public Information regarding the Company's business partners. All employees should treat Material Non-public Information about the Company's business partners with the same care as is required with respect to information relating directly to the Company.\n\nDefinition of Material Non-public Information\n\nIt is not possible to define all categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would be considered important to an investor in making an investment decision regarding the purchase or sale of the Company's"

The costs of defending any litigation, whether in cash expenses or in management time, could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. An unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant settlement costs. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nOur failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights and data may adversely affect us.\n\nAs of March 29, 2024, we held 134 issued U.S. patents and 47 issued foreign patents, and had 43 patent applications pending. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, licensing arrangements, maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures, we can give no assurances that any patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us, or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all. We can give no assurances that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate our technologies or design around the patents that we own. In addition, effective patent, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future.\n\nWe may enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and vendors and our customers, as needed, and generally\n\nlimit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurances that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, we have taken in the past, and may take in the future, legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and other resources, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n43\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur use of open source software in some of our products may expose us to certain risks.\n\nSome of our products contain software modules licensed for use from third-party authors under open source licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This could allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and in less time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.\n\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source closely, it is possible our past, present or future use of open source has triggered or may trigger the\n\nforegoing requirements. Furthermore, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe are subject to import and export control and trade and economic sanction laws and regulations that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\n\nOur products are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be exported outside the United States only with the required export license or through an\n\nexport license exception, in most cases because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. We are also subject to U.S. trade and economic sanction regulations which include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to the United States embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.

Pursuant to regulations that remained in place until 2018, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies were allowed to engage in transactions with Iran if certain requirements were met. In February 2023, OFAC notified us that it had completed its review of these matters and closed its review with the issuance of a Cautionary Letter. While OFAC did not assess any penalties, the Cautionary Letter does not preclude OFAC from taking future enforcement actions if additional information warrants renewed attention. Furthermore, OFAC may consider our regulatory history, including this subpoena, our disclosures and the Cautionary Letter, if we are involved in future enforcement cases for failure to comply with export control laws and regulations. If we are found to have violated U.S. export control laws as a result of future investigations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws which could lead to penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise.\n\nIn addition, we may be subject to customs duties that could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results or, if we are able to pass on the\n\nrelated costs in any particular situation, would increase the cost of the related product to our customers. As a result, the future imposition of significant increases in the level of customs duties or the creation of import quotas on our products in Europe or in other jurisdictions, or any of the limitations on international sales described above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Further, some of our customers in Europe have been, or are being, audited by local governmental authorities regarding the tariff classifications used for importation of our products. Import duties and tariffs vary by country and a different tariff classification for any of our products may result in higher duties or tariffs, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and potentially increase the cost of the related products to our customers.\n\n47\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur business and industry are subject to various laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nOur business and industry are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws. For example, we are subject to environmental\n\nregulations such as the European Union\u2019s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cWEEE\u201d) and Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (\u201cRoHS\u201d) directives and similar legislation enacted in other jurisdictions worldwide. Our failure to comply with these laws could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in such regions and countries. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they would likely result in additional costs, and could require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe are"
