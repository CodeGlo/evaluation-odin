Camp Requirement: As we have well discussed earlier, the existing PDO approved PAC facilities have been considered for PECO and TESCO accommodation, however, due to non-occupancy with existing PAC facilities in Marmul, we are forced to build our own camp.\n\nThe establishment of camp facility is a highly challenging task wherein additional resources inclusive of manpower, tools and tackles are engaged which have not been the part of initial planning.\n\nAlso, the non-availability of occupancy in the existing PAC has affected our earlier mobilization and also affecting the present mobilization.\n\nKindly note our below responses on other issues mentioned in your letter reference no. J12046-TWL-PECO- L-0064:\n\nInsufficient manpower: As stated above, we are committed towards achievement of catch-up plan targets. Inline with the requirements, we have mobilized all key persons at site and also mobilizing manpower for piping activities. Permit holders/ applicants and supervisors are already mobilized to ensure the interrupted work-flow. Mr. Jagdishan will lead Civil works under the leadership of Project Manager.\n\nNon-qualified Welders: We would like to inform you that WPS/PQR have been cartied-out with limited welders which is in line with normal procedure. However, we need to qualify additional welders considering the scope requirement of the project and to meet the targets lined-out in catch-up plan.\n\nAlso note that we are mobilizing the welders who are previously qualified in earlier projects, yet, they shall be qualified for every new project as per the procedure.\n\nGRE Piping Works: As requested, we have already deployed Third Party Inspection agency to expedite the GRE piping works. We will ensure the completion of targets for April 2022.\n\nPainting Yard for Piping Works: We have finalized (Purchased Order issued) the well qualified painting agency stationed in Salalah wherein all painting activities will be carried out as per the Project standards. We will ensure seamless transportation of piping material from site to paint shop and return. This is inline with the contract. Contrarily, the establishment of paint shop at site location will be additional cost and time which will hamper the project progress and also there will be safety concerns in running Project environment. Hence, we would like to request you to support to proceed with in finalized painting agency.\n\n1SO9001 1S0 14001\n\nDistinguished Presence, Innovative Technologies, Optimal Solutions Ee,\n\nTOWELL ENGINEERING SERVICES CO, LLC p.e.co Apwsigl Cibasdtl J gli As yi\n\nP.O.

Camp Requirement: As we have well discussed earlier, the existing PDO approved PAC facilities have been considered for PECO and TESCO accommodation, however, due to non-occupancy with existing PAC facilities in Marmul, we are forced to build our own camp.\n\nThe establishment of camp facility is a highly challenging task wherein additional resources inclusive of manpower, tools and tackles are engaged which have not been the part of initial planning.\n\nAlso, the non-availability of occupancy in the existing PAC has affected our earlier mobilization and also affecting the present mobilization.\n\nKindly note our below responses on other issues mentioned in your letter reference no. J12046-TWL-PECO- L-0064:\n\nInsufficient manpower: As stated above, we are committed towards achievement of catch-up plan targets. Inline with the requirements, we have mobilized all key persons at site and also mobilizing manpower for piping activities. Permit holders/ applicants and supervisors are already mobilized to ensure the interrupted work-flow. Mr. Jagdishan will lead Civil works under the leadership of Project Manager.\n\nNon-qualified Welders: We would like to inform you that WPS/PQR have been cartied-out with limited welders which is in line with normal procedure. However, we need to qualify additional welders considering the scope requirement of the project and to meet the targets lined-out in catch-up plan.\n\nAlso note that we are mobilizing the welders who are previously qualified in earlier projects, yet, they shall be qualified for every new project as per the procedure.\n\nGRE Piping Works: As requested, we have already deployed Third Party Inspection agency to expedite the GRE piping works. We will ensure the completion of targets for April 2022.\n\nPainting Yard for Piping Works: We have finalized (Purchased Order issued) the well qualified painting agency stationed in Salalah wherein all painting activities will be carried out as per the Project standards. We will ensure seamless transportation of piping material from site to paint shop and return. This is inline with the contract. Contrarily, the establishment of paint shop at site location will be additional cost and time which will hamper the project progress and also there will be safety concerns in running Project environment. Hence, we would like to request you to support to proceed with in finalized painting agency.\n\n1SO9001 1S0 14001\n\nDistinguished Presence, Innovative Technologies, Optimal Solutions Ee,\n\nTOWELL ENGINEERING SERVICES CO, LLC p.e.co Apwsigl Cibasdtl J gli As yi\n\nP.O.

We will ensure the remaining material will be available at site for uninterrupted piping fabrication works.\n\n\u00a2 Spoolgen \u2014 We have already finalized M/s PARASCADD for spooling. PECO representatives have attended the common meeting between PARASCADD, PECO & Towell.\n\n\u00a2 Camp Construction \u2014 As stated above in point no. #2 & #5, camp construction is an additional requirement which is highly challenging task wherein additional resources inclusive of manpower, tools and tackles are engaged which have not been the part of initial planning. Also, we have noted the delay in payments from Contractor. Also, there are always limitations of availability of accommodation for the workforce at existing PAC. Hence, the camp works has been delayed, however, we are ensuring all our efforts to meet the stated target.\n\ne We will ensure the required catering facility at camp.\n\ne We have mobilized highly experienced in charge to manage the warehouse. Also, additional manpower to meet the requirements have been mobilized.\n\nIn view of above, the point nos. 1,2,3,4 and 5 are the major reasons behind the delay of project which not attributable to Subcontractor. The equipment delays have pushed the contract completion date from October 2022 to Match 2023. The non-availability of PAC occupancy has surfaced as major challenge for mobilization resoutces wherein Subcontractor has to establish new camp facility for the Project with additional resources and approvals from Authorities. The payment delays have affected the cash-flow for the project and hampered the progress adversely.\n\n\" \u201d \u201d x zs . . 1S0 9001 Distinguished Presence, Innovative Technologies, Optimal Solutions\n\n1SO 14001 OHSAS 18001\n\nTOWELL ENGINEERING SERVICES CO.LLC pva.co4 Apunsighl ciLasdl gti As yt\n\nP.O.

Camp Requirement: As we have well discussed earlier, the existing PDO approved PAC facilities have been considered for PECO and TESCO accommodation, however, due to non-occupancy with existing PAC facilities in Marmul, we are forced to build our own camp.\n\nThe establishment of camp facility is a highly challenging task wherein additional resources inclusive of manpower, tools and tackles are engaged which have not been the part of initial planning.\n\nAlso, the non-availability of occupancy in the existing PAC has affected our earlier mobilization and also affecting the present mobilization.\n\nKindly note our below responses on other issues mentioned in your letter reference no. J12046-TWL-PECO- L-0064:\n\nInsufficient manpower: As stated above, we are committed towards achievement of catch-up plan targets. Inline with the requirements, we have mobilized all key persons at site and also mobilizing manpower for piping activities. Permit holders/ applicants and supervisors are already mobilized to ensure the interrupted work-flow. Mr. Jagdishan will lead Civil works under the leadership of Project Manager.\n\nNon-qualified Welders: We would like to inform you that WPS/PQR have been cartied-out with limited welders which is in line with normal procedure. However, we need to qualify additional welders considering the scope requirement of the project and to meet the targets lined-out in catch-up plan.\n\nAlso note that we are mobilizing the welders who are previously qualified in earlier projects, yet, they shall be qualified for every new project as per the procedure.\n\nGRE Piping Works: As requested, we have already deployed Third Party Inspection agency to expedite the GRE piping works. We will ensure the completion of targets for April 2022.\n\nPainting Yard for Piping Works: We have finalized (Purchased Order issued) the well qualified painting agency stationed in Salalah wherein all painting activities will be carried out as per the Project standards. We will ensure seamless transportation of piping material from site to paint shop and return. This is inline with the contract. Contrarily, the establishment of paint shop at site location will be additional cost and time which will hamper the project progress and also there will be safety concerns in running Project environment. Hence, we would like to request you to support to proceed with in finalized painting agency.\n\n1SO9001 1S0 14001\n\nDistinguished Presence, Innovative Technologies, Optimal Solutions Ee,\n\nTOWELL ENGINEERING SERVICES CO, LLC p.e.co Apwsigl Cibasdtl J gli As yi\n\nP.O.

We will ensure the completion of targets for April 2022.\n\nPainting Yard for Piping Works: We have finalized (Purchased Order issued) the well qualified painting agency stationed in Salalah wherein all painting activities will be carried out as per the Project standards. We will ensure seamless transportation of piping material from site to paint shop and return. This is inline with the contract. Contrarily, the establishment of paint shop at site location will be additional cost and time which will hamper the project progress and also there will be safety concerns in running Project environment.
