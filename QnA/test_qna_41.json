It is extremely difficult to convince them, how one machine SCR 2 has been taken over and put into commercial operation by the customer for nearly one year without clearing outstanding payment of INR 2.40 Crores to Sandvik .

In case of imported material, the exemption was made available only against custom duty but IGST @ 18% of CIF value against all the imported materials was levied. The full GST payment was being made against all indigenous supplies. The GST was made applicable @ 18% to 28% which now has been brought down to 18% against most of items.\n\nMs. NTPC took a decision on 6\" Nov. 2017 for partial reimbursement of GST at the rate of 14.5% against levy of 28/ 18%. Even from the partial reimbursement\n\nof 14.5%, the 5% was deducted towards input tax credit which was not applicable as all the input tax credits were available during the earlier tax regime also. Thus in actuals only 9.5% was reimbursed against 28/ 8% GST. The implementation of the decision took another 1 to 2 months on finalization of invoice format and other formalities. As such the decision for reimbursement of partial GST payment could be implemented almost after 8 months and that too the same was initially applicable only for another 3 months\u2019 time, i.e. upto March, 2018 and thereafter on June 2018 has extended Upto Jan. 2019 for two month prior to propose COD of the units. Thereafter again on our repeated submissions GST payment was agreed to be made after to 21 months i.e. on 15-4-2020.The actual payment not yet received but full GST has not been admitted/ made even till date\n\nWe have been repeatedly submitting to NTPC that the GST was complete overhauling of indirect tax structure of the country. The complete Constitution with all relevant Articles of our constitution in respect of Indirect Taxes have been Deleted and instead of new provisions have been incorporated levying GST Therefore it may not be treated as ordinary amendment to tax provisions and the existing provisions of the contract would be no more valid . Our contract was governed by old constitutional provisions of indirect taxes and since the same no more exist, either the contract become Void to that extent or the provisions with regard to indirect taxes be amended to provide for GST payment to keep the contract remain valid &so as to make the same at par for both the parties.\n\nIt would also be Unjust Enrichment also for NTPC as GST was\n\nincorporated/being incorporated as a capital cost for tariff purpose. But in spite of\n\nsame its payment was inordinately delayed and full payment was not made to us.\n\nThus NTPC enriched itself by 3.5 % to 13.5 % besides interest charged from us Engineered Durable Products\n\nSAHIBABAD WORKS: SIKANDRABAD WORKS:\n\n45/1, NEW INDUTRIAL AREA, SITE- 4, A-14, SIKANDRABAD INDUSTRIAL AREA SAHIBABAD (U.P.) - 201 010 SIKANDRABAD (U.P.) - 203 205 PHONE: +91 120 4756460 PHONE: +91 5735 222657\n\nb FAX =: #915735 221613 FAX =: +91 120 4756463 1SO 9004 : 2015\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\n2 Ai)\n\n2.Aii)\n\nSheet-6\n\nSOLA/CHP/Reply/July/01 dated 3 July 2020.

Scarcity of sand, metal around Solapur\n\nWhen we commenced the civil works were informed that there used to be a local Govt. restrictions on mining of sand and metal for construction purpose in and around Solapur. The Notifications are issued by district authorities every year. As a matter of fact, the District Authorities / Mining Deptt. were auctioning the mining of sand\n\n& and metal for limit period excavation. The auctioning taken place around Sept. to Oct/Nov. every year. The Mining Deptt. finalized tenders from Oct. to Dec. every year and. the Mining rights are awarded to successful parties for mining for a definite period which is approx. for six months from Feb. to Sept. every year.\n\nThe following notifications restriction the mining activities for six months during 2014, 2015 and 2016 may kindly be referred in this regard.\n\nNOTIFICATION NO.& DATE Office/2/Guokh/RR/1935/14/Solapur 22.12.2014\n\nOffice/2/Guokh/RR/4014/Solapur did. 14:16.2075 Office/2/Guokh/RR/2931/Solapur 25.10.2016\n\nThe above notifications are for 2014, 2015 and 2016. But similar process was for earlier years also whereby mining had been restricted for almost six months every year.\n\nThe copies of the same are attached herewith for your perusal and ready reference. The restrictions of mining of sand/ metal were neither specified in tender documents nor informed to us during finalization of the contract.\n\nIn the process during that period the sand and metal had to be procured from far-away from Solapur.

As a matter of fact, the villagers had forced the workers staying at adjoining places, to left Solapur and not joined the work at site. During the villagers agitation less than 10% of the workforce somehow could be taken to site. After the agitation was over the workforce which left Solapur earlier had again come to site, In the process work was stopped almost for 1% months for no fault of ours. The same was already informed to NTPC by our various communications from time to time and neither NTPC nor district authorities. could take any corrective checks either to remove the workers / villagers surrounding the project site nor could reach any settlement with them.

We had also requested to NTPC vide our various communications for taking up with the state government for not unnecessarily harassing us on this account. NTPC had accordingly taken up the state government authorities but inspite of the same the various notices and stop payments was issued by Tahsildar on 22.02.2016 and thereby our payments were to be hold for a long time.\n\nM/s.

Accordingly, the pile cap designs / drawings submitted by us on 8.6.2016 and the same were approved on 15.9.16. However, when we / our sub-contractor excavated the area, for breaking the pile for pile cap we observed that location of piles are not as per the approved pile layout in stacker reclaimer area. Therefore we have to either discard these piles or if possible change the pile cap drawing and accommodate the existing piles so as to do the further civil work as per requirement of the stacker reclaimer.\n\nWe are now looking for both the possibilities and incase it would be\n\n@ possible to use the existing piles we shall redesign the pile cap and subsequent civil works. Incase it would not be possible to use the existing piles we have to do the piles once again and in that event NTPC has to pay the extra expenditure in lieu of existing piles. In any case it delayed the further civil works by atleast four (4) months.\n\n2. Delay in Payment i Inordinate delay in advance against supply and service:\n\nWe have submitted the Bank Guarantees and other documents for Advance payment on 11\" December 2016 against first contract i.e. supply. However the advance payment for first contract / supply contract was released progressively upto 25.4.16 i.e. after adelay of five (5) months of signing of the contract agreement and submission of Advance \u2018and Performance Bank Guarantees. :\n\naoe\n\noa) You will kindly appreciate that no contractor can keep the investment on margin money and commission paid to the bank for such a long period as happened incase of release of advance payments against supply . It would be un-economical to make the heavy investment in the form of margin money and commission paid to the bank, if the advance payment is released after such along delay. We had therefore initially thought not to claim the advance payment against second contract.\n\nBut later on we have submitted the bank guarantee and invoices for the advance payment against service contract on 21% November 2016 but the payment of the same was also inordinately delayed by KBUNL due to shortage of funds and last advance was released only on 24\" April 2017 ie after delay of upto seven months. .\n\nEngineered Durable Products\n\nsilicon JASANZ = Works 1: Works 2:\n\nAt i_ 45/1, NEW INDUSTRIAL AREA, PLOT No, 14,\n\nS iG SITE NO. 4, SAHIBABAD (U.P.) - 201 010 SIKANDRABAD INDUSTRIAL AREA\n\na manor ~\u2014 PHONE : 0120-4756460 SIKANDRABAD (U.P.}-203205 480 9001;2008\n\nCoriticate FAX : 0120-4756463 PHONE : 05735-222657 CIN : U74899DL1970PTC005272\n\nINDURE continuation sheet\n\n24\n\nii Delay in opening of the L/C and release of LIC payment therein\n\nThe contract as per cl. 5 was provided for opening of the L/C for supply portion of the contract for release of dispatch payment.
