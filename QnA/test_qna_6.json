            " Claim Towards Cost Incurred Due to Claimant\u2019s Delays in Project Management Consultant (PMC) Contract\u2014 INR 282,629,632.68/-\n\nThe Contract between the Claimant and the Respondent was executed on 06.08.2013 and the stipulated date for completion of the Milestone-3 works was 09.02.2017.\n\nM/s NK. Consortium was appointed as the PMC for the Project with effect from 11 April 2014.The contract was for a period of 6 years from the date of award of consultancy contract including 4 years of construction period and 2 years of Defect Notification Period (DNP). Copy of the contract agreement between PMC and DFCCIL dated 27 March 2014 has been annexed as Exhibit R-1.\n\nAs evident, the PMC contract was for a specified period, however due to continued delay by the Claimant, the PMC was compelled to stay at site, during the delay affected days. It is pertinent to note that the payment to PMC had been agreed in terms of the utilization of its manpower based on deployed man-months.\n\nFurther, it is pertinent to mention that this PMC which was engaged for CTP 1&2, was also responsible for supervision of Civil and track works for other packages including CTP 3R, CTP 3AR, EMP4, STP 5. Since, the bifurcation of fee payable to the PMC under these packages was not provided under the Contract, so the weightage contribution of all packages is calculated based on contract value of each package. Accordingly, the weightage of CTP 1&2 is computed as 40.24% as detailed in Exhibit R- 257.\n\nThe detailed working and calculation for additional amount incurred by the Respondent towards stay of the PMC at site during delay affected days is attached as Exhibit R-257. The Respondent calculated the cost of PMC by calculating the per day cost from total expenditure of PMC from the appointment of the Engineer to the Cut-off date (31.08.2016). For calculation, per day cost is multiplied with delay affected days i.e., 303 days to obtain the cost of the PMC for CTP 1&2 package.\n\n140-\n\nStep-1: Per day cost of PMC for all packages = (Total amount incurred all packages) / (Total no. of days till cut-off date i.e., 874 days) = 2,026,072,931.98 / 874 days = INR 2,318,161.25/- Step-2: Cost of PMC for 303 days = (Per day cost of PMC) x (303 days) = INR 2,318,161.25* 303 days\n\n= INR 702,402,858.57/- Thus, cost incurred due to the Claimant\u2019s delays in the PMC Contract is INR\n\n702,402,858.57\n\nStep- 3: Amount dedicated to CTP 1&2 = 40.24% of the cost of PMC for 303 days = 40.24% * INR 702,402,858.57 = INR 282,629,632.68/- The total cost incurred by the Respondent towards expenses incurred in PMC Contract\n\nfor CTP 1&2 package comes to INR 282,629,632.68/-.\n\nBased on the above, the Respondent has incurred the additional cost in CTP 1&2 package on account of engagement of the PMC during delay affected days. The Respondent prays that above-mentioned amount should be awarded to the Respondent. Counter Claim 3: Claim Towards Loss of Track Access Charges (TAC) Due to Delayed Commissioning of the Rewari \u2014 Iqbalgarh Section - INR 1140,08,00,000. It is submitted that DFCCIL has been mandated to build and operate the Dedicated Freight Corridors (\"DFCs\") in the \"Golden Quadrilateral\u2019 which shall endeavour to move more than 60% of the total freight traffic transported by Indian Railways (\"IR\"). DFCCIL is intended to be an independent organisation which can help to facilitate the development of competition in the rail market and fund investment in the network \u2014 separated from IR's wider obligations and constraints. The DFCs will offer significantly improved rail freight capacity and capability with higher axle loads, higher speeds and without conflicts between passenger and freight trains which operate at different speeds. The DFCs are expected to provide a major increase in the track capacity in India to accommodate rising freight transport demand.\n\nThe relationship between MOR and DFCCIL is currently defined through the Concession Agreement (CA) dt.28.02.2014 followed by an amendment on 31.03.2021. As per the agreement, DFCCIL is under a concession from MOR to design, build"

On 18 March 2021, PCTL had further requested ASE for smooth approval of diagonal columns for erection stating that \u201cThe inspection and acceptance criteria has been unilaterally finalized ASE/BAEC only after the casting of 100 columns by introducing multistage inspection (3- Stages) between removal of formwork and final inspection for approving the FK1 prior to erection. However, 20 columns were already finished under supervision of PCTL, ASE & BAEC but ASE/BAEC did not approve these columns till date and therefore FK1 could not be approved. Further in the same letter PCTL stated that \u201cIt is a matter of fact and record that we have already erected 34 Columns out of 42 and balance 8 will be erected by today. Further, there will be no available approved Columns for erection and progress of erection will be jeopardized due to the non-availability of the approved columns.\u201d62\n\n144.

On 25 March 2021, ASE wrote to PCTL regarding multi-stage inspection of raker columns stating that \u201c we would like to inform you that JSC ASE Branch in Bangladesh was forced to introduce multi-stage inspection of raker columns. As you are testing out the technology of column casting, and exhibit unstable level of quality and defects, this is the only possible approach at the moment.\u201d65\n\n147. On 31 March 2021, ASE had requested PCTL to take necessary action for clearance FK1 stating that \u201cwe would like to inform that step-by-step (multi-stage) monitoring has been initiated by BAEC and JSC ASE Branch in Bangladesh as part of monitoring procedures on elimination of defects and cases of unauthorized repair activities without prior notification of the Commission from Paharpur Cooling Towers LTD.\u201d66\n\n148. On 27 April 2021, ASE had informed PCTL to remove all rejected racker column stating that \u201cJSC ASE Branch in Bangladesh does not approve re-scheduling of the deadlines, as these deadlines were personally set by the management of Paharpur-MIL JV, Paharpur Cooling Towers Ltd. and not all decisions of the report agreed on by Paharpur-MIL JV, Paharpur Cooling Towers Ltd. were fulfilled. Therefore, the columns which do not match the crite1ia stipulated in the joint inspection report of BAEC and JSC ASE Branch in Bangladesh, are considered rejected by the joint inspection. Based on the above, JSC ASE Branch in Bangladesh demands that you remove these columns and informs you that if any unauthorized actions are taken by Paharpur-MIL JV and Paharpur Cooling Towers we will have to investigate the companies actions.\u201d67\n\n149.

            "\n\nI consider the lighting and small electrical works, and cable trench works to be the dominant\n\ncauses of delay leading up to the start of GIS installation works on 20 February 2016. I set out\n\na brief chronology of these works in the following paragraphs.\n\nLighting and small electrical works\n\n189. From my review of the baseline programme, there was no specific activity for lighting and\n\nsmall electrical installation works (such as fire alarm works, sockets, conduits, wire pulling,\n\nand switches).\n\n190. However, as shown in Figure 73 below, the method statement for the 400kV GIS installation\n\ndetailed that lighting fixtures should be completed prior to commencing the GIS installation:\n\nFigure 73: Extract from method statement of 400kV GIS installation.234\n\n190.1.\n\nFurthermore, on the schedule for hand over to the 400kV GIS equipment installation\n\nteam dated 15 February 2016 as shown in Figure 24, the installation and wiring of\n\nlighting fixtures were expected to be completed prior to the start of GIS equipment\n\ninstallation.\n\n191. With regards to small electrical works, as shown on Figure 19 above, the schedule of works\n\nprior to the planned start of GIS installation dated 22 October 2015 included \u201cConduits Work\u201d.\n\n191.1.\n\nFurthermore, on 3 November 2015, POSCO noted that \u201celectrical works\u201d must be\n\nfinished before the arrival of the GIS supervisor, however, the exact extent of\n\nelectrical works to be completed was not specified.\n\n234 2016 01 16 \u2010 BS\u2010BST\u2010POS\u2010T\u20100103 [R\u2010159].\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 67 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\n192. Accordingly, on the basis of the above, and as detailed at paragraph 186, it is reasonable to\n\nsuggest that lighting installation and small electrical works was planned to progress in the 31\u2010\n\nday period between the planned completion of the ground floor (12 August 2015) and the\n\nplanned start of the 400kV GIS installation works (12 September 2015).\n\n193. In the event, the lighting and small electrical works were sufficiently progressed by\n\n20 February 2016, when the GIS installation works commenced.\n\n194. From my review of the available documents, I am unable to determine with certainty the\n\nreasons why these works took longer than planned, however, I reviewed the\n\ncontemporaneously reported issues and the epoxy flooring235 (shown in Figure 74 below), to\n\nestablish the likely causes of slower than planned progress of the lighting and small electrical\n\nworks (i.e., red diamonds and bars):\n\n235 Excluding works which appear to be epoxy flooring preparatory works.\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 68 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\nFigure 74: As\u2010built construction and reported issues of lighting and small electrical works.\n\n194.1.\n\nFrom my review, it seems that the above reported issues affected the progress of\n\nthe lighting installation or small electrical works as follows:\n\nReported issue\n\nMOE approval of lighting switches and sockets Missing light fixtures Missing lighting DC power wire Missing exposed boxes Missing welding socket outlets Missing MT sockets & wire material Missing lighting clamps Approval of FAS wire Approval of small outlet sockets Rework to lighting installation Rework to conduit installation\n\nPeriod that progress may have been affected\n\nFinish Start Unknown (if any) 05\u2010Dec\u201015 22\u2010Dec\u201015\n\nDuration Undetermined (if any) 17\n\n5\u2010Jan\u201016 10\u2010Jan\u201016 09\u2010Feb\u201016 30\u2010Jan\u201016\n\nNone236 Undetermined (if any) None237 Undetermined (if any) Undetermined (if any) 18\u2010Feb\u201016 17\u2010Feb\u201016 10\u2010Feb\u201016 12\u2010Feb\u201016\n\n45 39 2 13\n\nFigure 75: Summary of reported issues that potentially affected progress to lighting installation or small electrical works.\n\n236 As set out in paragraph 216 to 220, from my review, this reported issue did not affect the progress of lighting or small electrical works. 237 As set out in paragraph 225 to 227, from my review, this reported issue did not affect the progress of lighting or small electrical works.\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 69 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\n194.2",

In addition to the above reported issues, epoxy flooring was also carried out in periods when\n\nno lighting and small electrical works progressed. In the paragraphs below, I set out my\n\nreview of the epoxy flooring and the above reported issues in relation to the progress of the\n\nlighting and small electrical works.\n\nEpoxy flooring\n\n196. The application of the epoxy flooring works commenced on or around 26 November 2015 and\n\nlikely prevented access to the internal area and consequently affected the progress of lighting\n\nand small electrical works in the following periods:\n\n196.1.\n\nFrom 26 to 30 November 2015 (5 days)239:\n\n238 BEST Daily Report noted 1 January 2016 as a non\u2010working Friday [R\u201014]. 239 I note that there are no site photographs of the 400kV GIS Building internal area on 30 November 2015, however, POSCO\u2019s daily report on this day noted that epoxy works were in progress and as such, in my opinion, the epoxy flooring appears to have continued to prevent the progress of lighting and small electrical works up to 30 November 2015 [R\u201020]. By 1 December 2015, BEST reported the lighting and small electrical works had recommenced [R\u201014].\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 70 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\nFigure 76: Site photographs dated 26 November 2015, 27 November 2015, and 29 November 2015.240\n\n196.2.\n\nFrom 6 to 9 December 2015 (4 days):\n\n240 BEST Daily Reports [R\u201014].\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 71 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\nFigure 77: Site photographs dated 6 December 2015241, 7 December 2015242, and 9 December 2015243.\n\n197. Furthermore, BEST did not report any lighting or small electrical works in the above periods.\n\n198. As shown in Figure 74 above, limited (if any) lighting and small electrical works seem to have\n\nprogressed during the application of the epoxy flooring. However, as epoxy flooring would\n\nalways have to be done, and in acknowledging the extent of the floor area of the 400kV GIS\n\nBuilding, it is likely that the epoxy works would always have affected the progress of any other\n\ninternal works being carried out around the same time and therefore, would/should have\n\nbeen accommodated in the baseline programme.\n\n199. In the event, it seems that the application of the epoxy flooring application did affect the\n\nprogress of the lighting and small electrical works for around 9 days.244 However, absent a\n\n241 BEST Daily Report dated 6 December 2015 [R\u201014]. 242 BEST Daily Report dated 7 December 2015 [R\u201014]. 243 POSCO Daily Report dated 9 December 2015 [R\u201020]. 244 Refer to Figure 19, on 22 October 2015, epoxy flooring was planned to take 8 days.\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 72 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\ndetailed baseline programme, I am unable to quantify (with certainty) the critical delay due to\n\nthese works.\n\nMOE approval of lighting equipment\n\n200. By 11 November 2015, installation of conduits for lighting had been in progress for around a\n\nweek in the 400kV GIS Building:\n\nFigure 78: Site photograph dated 11 November 2015.245\n\n201.

            " Claim Towards Cost Incurred Due to Claimant\u2019s Delays in Project Management Consultant (PMC) Contract\u2014 INR 282,629,632.68/-\n\nThe Contract between the Claimant and the Respondent was executed on 06.08.2013 and the stipulated date for completion of the Milestone-3 works was 09.02.2017.\n\nM/s NK. Consortium was appointed as the PMC for the Project with effect from 11 April 2014.The contract was for a period of 6 years from the date of award of consultancy contract including 4 years of construction period and 2 years of Defect Notification Period (DNP). Copy of the contract agreement between PMC and DFCCIL dated 27 March 2014 has been annexed as Exhibit R-1.\n\nAs evident, the PMC contract was for a specified period, however due to continued delay by the Claimant, the PMC was compelled to stay at site, during the delay affected days. It is pertinent to note that the payment to PMC had been agreed in terms of the utilization of its manpower based on deployed man-months.\n\nFurther, it is pertinent to mention that this PMC which was engaged for CTP 1&2, was also responsible for supervision of Civil and track works for other packages including CTP 3R, CTP 3AR, EMP4, STP 5. Since, the bifurcation of fee payable to the PMC under these packages was not provided under the Contract, so the weightage contribution of all packages is calculated based on contract value of each package. Accordingly, the weightage of CTP 1&2 is computed as 40.24% as detailed in Exhibit R- 257.\n\nThe detailed working and calculation for additional amount incurred by the Respondent towards stay of the PMC at site during delay affected days is attached as Exhibit R-257. The Respondent calculated the cost of PMC by calculating the per day cost from total expenditure of PMC from the appointment of the Engineer to the Cut-off date (31.08.2016). For calculation, per day cost is multiplied with delay affected days i.e., 303 days to obtain the cost of the PMC for CTP 1&2 package.\n\n140-\n\nStep-1: Per day cost of PMC for all packages = (Total amount incurred all packages) / (Total no. of days till cut-off date i.e., 874 days) = 2,026,072,931.98 / 874 days = INR 2,318,161.25/- Step-2: Cost of PMC for 303 days = (Per day cost of PMC) x (303 days) = INR 2,318,161.25* 303 days\n\n= INR 702,402,858.57/- Thus, cost incurred due to the Claimant\u2019s delays in the PMC Contract is INR\n\n702,402,858.57\n\nStep- 3: Amount dedicated to CTP 1&2 = 40.24% of the cost of PMC for 303 days = 40.24% * INR 702,402,858.57 = INR 282,629,632.68/- The total cost incurred by the Respondent towards expenses incurred in PMC Contract\n\nfor CTP 1&2 package comes to INR 282,629,632.68/-.\n\nBased on the above, the Respondent has incurred the additional cost in CTP 1&2 package on account of engagement of the PMC during delay affected days. The Respondent prays that above-mentioned amount should be awarded to the Respondent. Counter Claim 3: Claim Towards Loss of Track Access Charges (TAC) Due to Delayed Commissioning of the Rewari \u2014 Iqbalgarh Section - INR 1140,08,00,000. It is submitted that DFCCIL has been mandated to build and operate the Dedicated Freight Corridors (\"DFCs\") in the \"Golden Quadrilateral\u2019 which shall endeavour to move more than 60% of the total freight traffic transported by Indian Railways (\"IR\"). DFCCIL is intended to be an independent organisation which can help to facilitate the development of competition in the rail market and fund investment in the network \u2014 separated from IR's wider obligations and constraints. The DFCs will offer significantly improved rail freight capacity and capability with higher axle loads, higher speeds and without conflicts between passenger and freight trains which operate at different speeds. The DFCs are expected to provide a major increase in the track capacity in India to accommodate rising freight transport demand.\n\nThe relationship between MOR and DFCCIL is currently defined through the Concession Agreement (CA) dt.28.02.2014 followed by an amendment on 31.03.2021. As per the agreement, DFCCIL is under a concession from MOR to design, build"

The amendments categorized projects into Category 'B1' and 'B2', with minor mineral leases under 50 hectares included in Category 'B'. The State of Rajasthan implemented these requirements, which led to delays in project approvals and infrastructure development, as seen in the delays in the commencement of embankment and other works due to the requirement of EC and subsequent legal challenges.",

State of Haryana, (2012) 4 SCC 629 was delivered. The Court directed that all leases pertaining to minor minerals, including renewals for areas of less than 5 ha, would only be granted after obtaining EC clearance from the MoEF. Accordingly, the requirement for prior EC for mining leases of less than 5 ha existed well before the Base Date of the Contract. For this reason, there was no \u201cchange in law\u201d after the Base Date.\n\nSubsequently, in compliance with the directions of the Supreme Court, the MoEF issued an OM dated 18 May 2012 which clarified that new and existing leases below 5 ha., would be treated as Category \u2018B\u2019 under the EIA Notification 2006.\n\nOn 19 June 2012, the Government of Rajasthan, by way of a gazette notification, amended Rule 4 of the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1986 by adding sub-clause (12) under Rule 4, which stated that no mining lease could be granted in contravention of the EIA Notification 2006, complying with the Court\u2019s judgment.\n\nThe MoEF issued an OM dated 24 June 2013, which further categorized the activities of borrowing / excavation of \u2018brick earth\u2019 and \u2018ordinary earth\u2019 up to an area less than 5 ha. as Category \u2018B2\u2019. An amendment was then made on 9 September 2013 in Item 1(a) of the Schedule to the EIA Notification 2006, to the effect that all leases of minor minerals less than 50 ha. were to be included under Category \u2018B\u2019. The MoEF issued another OM dated 24 December 2013 regarding the categorisation of Category \u2018B\u2019 projects into Category \u2018B1\u2019 and \u2018B2\u2019. Following this OM, guidelines were issued by the Government on Rajasthan on 8 January 2014.\n\nHowever, the OM dated 24 December 2013 was stayed by the NGT on 28 March 2014 in Ranbir Singh v. State of H.P. & Ors, (2014 SCC OnLine NGT 382) noting that \u201cthe Office Memorandum is an administrative order and cannot frustrate the legislative act\u2019. The NGT on 6 June 2014, in Himmat Singh Shekhawat v. State of Rajasthan (2014 SCC OnLine NGT 2534) stayed the operation of the guidelines issued by the Government of Rajasthan on 8 January 2014 noting that the office memorandum was issued to wriggle out of the directions passed earlier by the Supreme Court by creating Category \u2018B2\u2019 having an area of less than 25 ha. and above 5 ha.\n\nICC 26834 \u2014 Final Award\n\n43-\n\n17.4\n\n17.5\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nNeither of these interim orders of the NGT altered the prevailing legal position that prior EC was required for the extraction of minor minerals, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in Deepak Kumar v. State of Haryana (supra).\n\nOn 13 January 2015, the NGT passed the final judgement in Himmat Singh Shekhawat v. State of Rajasthan & Ors. (2015 SCC OnLine NGT 846). Neither the NGT\u2019s interim orders, nor the final judgment in Himmat Singh Shekhawat v. State of Rajasthan altered the position. Thus, prior EC continued to be a pre-requisite for the grant of a licence for minor mineral leases for areas of less than 5 ha. throughout the relevant time.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent stating that it had approached the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (\u201cRSPCB\u201d) seeking consent to establish and operate a short-term permit quarry in the district of Ajmer, Rajasthan. The Claimant stated that the RSPCB had written back saying that EC was required to obtain a short-term permit for minor minerals in a lease area less than 5 ha. However, the Claimant failed to apply for EC. Instead, it asserted that there was a change in",
            " a change in legislation requiring EC before the State would issue a lease for the mining of minor minerals. The Ministry of Environment and Forest (\u201cMOEF\u201d) required EC as a pre- requisite for the State to issue a lease for mining of minor minerals from mines having an area less than 5 hectares. The State of Rajasthan decided to implement this requirement only in November 2013.\n\nOn 24 December 2013, MOEF issued guidelines by way of an Office Memorandum (\u201cOM\u201d) for categorizing projects under category B into B1 and B2. Mining of ordinary earth and stone/aggregate, for which EC was sought by Claimant, was under Category B2. On 8 January 2014, the State of Rajasthan implemented the OM and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority\n\nICC 26834 \u2014 Final Award\n\n35-\n\n16.5\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(\u201cSEIAA\u201d) was directed accordingly. Additional time beyond that envisaged in the Contract was required for the submission of an application for EC to SEIAA. Appraisal of the Claimant\u2019s application for EC was delayed by SEIAA, and was pending in June 2014 when the process was stayed by the NGT.\n\nBy orders dated 28 March 2014 and 6 June 2014, the NGT stayed the process of granting of EC in the State of Rajasthan. On 13 January 2015, the NGT vacated the stay order.\n\nOn 26 November 2014, the State of Rajasthan amended the mining rules under which excavation of earth up to 1.5 m for filling did not fall under mining, and no EC was required for the extraction of earth from borrow pits up to a depth of 1.5m for use in embankments. On 15 December 2014, the Claimant commenced embankment work after obtaining approvals from the State as per the amended mining rules.\n\nConsequently, there was delay in the commencement of the embankment, sub- grade, blanket, ballast and structures. This delay affected the Shriamirgarh - Dabla section in the State of Rajasthan, and consequently delayed the track work in the Rewari - Iqbalgarh section. The Engineer considered that this was the dominant delay to the completion of MS-3.\n\nAs for (3), the construction of RUBs:\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe Claimant had to design and construct a total of 304 RUBs, out of which 262 RUBs were to be constructed along with a similar RUB on the IR track (to be constructed by IR). At level crossings (\u201cLCs\u201d) the RUB on the IR track had to be constructed before the RUB on Respondent\u2019s track.\n\nThe Claimant could not commence and progress the RUBs due to: (i) a variation, requiring IR\u2019s approval, of the GAD prior to commencement of construction of the RUB; (1i) construction of the RUB on the Respondent\u2019s track being held up due to the non-completion by IR of the RUB on its track; (iii) encumbrances preventing completion of the RUBs; (iv) varied works relating to part completion of the RUBs; and (v) additions/variations to the RUB work originally envisaged.\n\nAs for (4), the non-handing over of unencumbered possession of land and the right of\n\nway:\n\n(1)\n\nUnder the Contract, the Respondent was required to hand over possession of an unencumbered Right of Way (\u201cROW\u201d), within the dates indicated in the Appendix to Bid. The unencumbered ROW from Bhagega to Rewari, and Bhagega to Biroliya, was to be handed over to the Claimant within 28 days of the Commencement Date, ie. on or before 27 September 2013. The section from Biroliya to Banas was to be handed over within 91 days of commencement (i.e. on 29 November 2013), and the balance within 182 days of commencement. (i.e. on 28 February 2014).\n\nICC 26834 \u2014 Final Award\n\n36 -\n\n(2) Handing over of the unencumbered ROW was done piecemeal and over a period of time. The ROW handed over in MS-3, by 31 August 2016, was not encumbrance free and was hindered by trees, buildings, cables, electric poles and water pipelines. The removal of these hindrances was the Respondent's obligation. Execution of work at some locations was also hindered by locals alleging non-payment of compensation by the Respondent.\n\n(3) As at 31 August 2016, 40.435 km in 414 patches"

        "question": "How do terms of reference affect arbitration if res judicata is later invoked?",
        "ground_truth": "In arbitration proceedings, the terms of reference determine the issues the Arbitrator has to decide. If a particular issue is included in the terms of reference, parties are estopped by the doctrine of res judicata from raising that issue in subsequent arbitration proceedings, even if the Arbitrator had made no award in relation to that issue.",
        "contexts": [
            " arise between the same parties out of the same agreement or set of agreements. All these provisions show that there can be multiple claims and multiple references at multiple stages. This Court in Krishna Construction Company v. Engineer Member, D.D.A., (2005) 122 DLT 54, relying upon Purser & Co, v. Jackson, [1977] Q.B. 166 held that in arbitration proceeding, it is the terms of reference of the arbitration which determine the issue which the Arbitrator has to decide; accordingly, ifa particular issue is included in the terms of reference, parties would be estopped by the doctrine of res judicata from raising that issue in subsequent arbitration proceedings even though the Arbitrator had made no award in relation to that issue. The senior counsels for the appellant are also correct in contending that this becomes further evident from Section 29A read with Section 23 of the Arbitration Act prescribing a period of six months, from the date the Arbitrator or all the Arbitrators have received notice of appointment, for completion of pleadings and period of 12 months therefrom for making the arbitral award.\u201d\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n2020 SCC Online Del 720\n\nICC 26834 \u2014 Final Award\n\n80 -\n\n23.39\n\n23.40\n\nSection 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure defines res judicata in the following terms: \u201cNo Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties... and has been heard and finally decided by such Court.\u201d The Tribunal considers that these principles are applicable to this arbitration. Consequently, the Claimant is estopped from raising in this arbitration, any matter which was decided in ICC 27047, or which was in issue in those proceedings.\n\nThe Claimant also contended, by reference to various authorities, that there can be multiple references to arbitration arising out of the same contract. However, this point is accepted by the Respondent. It is also not relevant in this case. Each reference to arbitration arising out of a single contract is subject to the rules of res judicata, as set out above.\n\n(2) Whether res judicata has been sufficiently pleaded and proved.\n\n23.41\n\n23.42\n\n23.43\n\n23.44\n\nThe Claimant has pointed out that res judicata is not a matter which was referred to in the Respondent\u2019s pleadings, and was not raised by the Respondent until its written opening submissions for the November 2023 hearing. The Respondent accepts that res judicata had not been pleaded, but says that there is no dispute that the matters relied on by the Claimant in the two arbitrations are the same.\n\nSince these are arbitration proceedings, and the technical rules relating to pleadings in court are not applicable, the essential test is whether the opposing party has had a fair opportunity to deal with the case which a party seeks to advance. In this case, the issue of res judicata was raised before the November 2023 hearing. Since then, both Parties have had many opportunities to make further submissions, both in writing\u201d and orally\u201d). In particular, the Claimant served written submissions specifically on the issue of res judicata.\u201d\n\nAs for proof of the matters relied on by the Respondent in this regard, the Respondent says that there is no dispute that the matters alleged in the two arbitrations are the same. The Tribunal is satisfied that no further evidence is needed for it to address this point. The relevant issue is not whether the claims in the two arbitrations are proved, but whether they are of the same nature. We note that the Claimant contended that it would have called evidence to demonstrate that the claims were made in the manner requested by the Engineer. But this is not relevant to whether those claims have already been decided in ICC 27047.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the Respondent\u2019s case on res judicata has been sufficiently pleaded, evidenced, and responded to, for it to be addressed in these proceedings.\n\n(3) Whether the Claimant\u2019s claims are interim and res judicata applies to such claims.\n\n23.45\n\nThe Claimant contends that its claims in the two arbitrations were interim, and so the principles of res judicata do not apply. The Respondent\u2019s position is that claims for EOT\n\n\u00ae See paragraph 8.1 above 7 In the 5 days of hearings for oral submissions in February and August 2024 On 9 April 2024\n\nICC 26834 \u2014 Final Award\n\n81-\n\n23.46\n\n23.47\n\nmay be interim and hence revised, but cost claims relate to the period when the delay occurred and so are not interim.\n\nThe Claimant relies on clause 20.1 of the"

Additionally, the poor quality of works by SPLL due to lack of skilled worker and unproductive workers at site led to significant delays in the Project. The poor workmanship was recorded in various communications, letters, reports and NCRs.\n\n173.

The Contractor's attendance on such provisional items shall be US Dollars 3,682,708.00 which shall be paid on pro rata basis. The Contractor shall be liable to provide all required facilities to the nominated Subcontractors including but not limited to Tower crane, Material & Manpower hoists, temporary roads, water, electricity, sanitary, welfare, offices, spaces for storages, clearing away rubbish and such as per the instruction of the Engineer. Payment to the nominated Subcontractors shall be made directly by the Employer but the payment application of the nominated Subcontractors shall be checked and recommended for payment to the Employer by the Contractor.\u201d46\n\n176.\n\nThus, as per the above clause, for managing and coordinating the works of the Nominated Subcontractors, SPLL was paid a supervision fee.\n\n177. As reported in MIS reports of the year 2015, there were severe delays to the Project due to delay\n\nin establishment of SPLL RMC plant.\n\n178. Also, there was constant shortage of skilled workers, mainly steel fixers and carpenters.\n\nMoreover, productivity of workers was reported low.\n\n179.\n\nThe MIS of year 2015 and 2016 recorded \u2013 \u201cLack of manpower, less productivity of workers, unavailability of contractor own batching plant\". This issue is elabourated in Section-7 of this report.\n\n180.\n\nThere was also many defective works done by the Contractor which is highlighted further in Section-7.\n\n181. Due to poor wooden work by SPLL, rework of wooden work had to be done. Further, other NSC was also appointed to perform this work. Thus, the Employer holds SPLL responsible for delays.\n\n182.\n\nThe Employer in its letter dated 4 August 2021 highlighted that \u201cIt is Main Contractor's responsibility to control and coordinate the site works to achieve the set milestone",

In response, IDPL highlighted that SPLL has been unable to provide a competent M&E Supervision and Co-ordination Team to properly monitor the progress or quality of the M&E works52.\n\n190. As per Clause 15 of the LOA document, \u201cKey Site Management/ Project Management and Technical Personnel proposed for the Contract shall be very strong and should have experience in Project planning and execution relevant to the high rise (tall building) construction\u201d.53\n\n191. Also, at few instances, the Contractor alleged that the Employer nominated inefficient\n\nNominated Subcontractors.\n\n192. On 13 August 2021, SPLL highlighted to IDPL that \u2013 \u201cthe Employer had never considered the rating criteria in our technical evaluation and has solely appointed the NSC based only on the commercial valuation, which is one of The main reasons for the gross failures of the NSC performance.\u201d54\n\n193. On 19 August 202155, the Employer wrote to the Contractor that they could have raised an objection on the appointment of any NSC by sending a notice, which was never done by the Contractor.\n\n194.\n\nThe Employer, in the same letter notified to the Contractor \u2013 \u201cAccording to the Sub-Clause 5.2 (Objection to Nomination) in Conditions of Contract, you have all the rights to raise your reasonable objection on appointment of NSC by a notice. We didn\u2019t receive any such notification from your end.\u201d 56\n\n195.\n\nThis allegation was completely inadmissible as pursuant to the Sub-Clause 5.2 in Conditions of Contract, SPLL had the right to object selection of NSC but IDPL never received any such notice from SPLL.\n\n196. As per the Sub-Clause 20.1 (Contractor's Claims) of the General Conditions of the Contract, \u201cif the Contractor considers himself to be entitled to any EOT and/or any additional payment, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer, describing the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim. If the Contractor fails to give such notice of a claim within such period of 28 days, the Time for Completion shall not be extended, the Contractor shall not be entitled to additional payment, and the Employer shall be discharged from all liability in connection with the claim\u201d.57\n\n197. As per contractual provisions, the Contractor was supposed to give Notice to the Engineer describing the events or the circumstances, within 28 days of occurrence of the delay events.

This does not permit the Tribunal to revise any agreement of the Parties. However, the agreed EOT is not in dispute. No determination pursuant to clause 3.5 of the Contract\u2019 was issued by the Engineer in respect of the causes of the delay, and so it is not necessary for the Tribunal to review or revise any such determination.\n\nThe Respondent also contends\u2019 that the Engineer\u2019s EOT determination was not based on a standard critical path analysis, and did not consider any delays for which the Claimant may be responsible, and which would impact the Claimant\u2019s entitlement to prolongation costs.\n\nMr Atkinson said that the Engineer\u2019s assessment:'\u2122 \u201ca) Does not provide a contemporaneous critical path over time until August 2016, but just a\n\ncritical path at 31 August 2016;\n\nb) Considers only the overall critical effect of the Employer's delay events, but not the effect of Contractor\u2019s delays;\n\n\u00a2) Considers only the impact of Employer delay events assessed as being \u2018critical\u2019;\n\nd) Does not attribute the 608 days Employer\u2019s delay (or extension of time) to specific Employer delay events, occurring at specific sections and at specific points in time; and\n\ne) Suggests that, at 31 August 2016, the critical area of the project was the RUBs at Dabla to Ateli, which was part of the MS-1.\n\na) It does not establish the timing of the critical Employer delays;\n\n105 April 2024 submissions, paragraph 27\n\n106 Clause 3.5: \u201cWhenever these Conditions provide that the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with this Sub-Clause 3.5 to agree or determine any matter, the Engineer shall consult with each Party in an endeavour to reach agreement. If agreement is not achieved, the Engineer shall make a fair determination in accordance with the Contract, taking due regard of all relevant circumstances.\u201d\n\n107 April 2024 submissions, paragraph 28\n\n15 Atkinson, 1\u2018 report, paragraphs 743-744\n\nICC 26834 ~",

The resulting period of EOT has been agreed by the Parties, and so is not open for review by the Tribunal. However, we find that this assessment cannot form the basis for any sound or reliable analysis for the purposes of ascertaining the Claimant's entitlement to prolongation costs.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that there is no basis for the Claimant\u2019s contention that the Respondent was bound by the Engineer\u2019s analysis unless it objected. The Claimant referred to clause 20.1,\"\"\u00b0 but this contains no provisions to support the Claimant's argument. Clause 3.5'!' deals with Determinations by the Engineer. But no Determination pursuant to this clause was issued by the Engineer in relation to the extension of time for MS-3, and the clause does not state that any such Determinations become binding. The only provisions of the Contract of this nature are in clause 20.4'!, and they relate to the potentially binding effect of decisions of the DAB, but that is not a relevant consideration here.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that it is not bound by the Engineer\u2019s assessment of EOT, and also finds that it is not a reliable basis on which to assess the Claimant\u2019s claims in this arbitration.\n\n109 Menon, 1* delay report, paragraph 57\n\n\"0 Quoted at paragraph 23.46 above.\n\n\"! Quoted at paragraph 25.15 and footnote 106 above.\n\n\"? Clause 20.4 includes these words: \u201cIf the DAB has given its decision as to a matter in dispute to both Parties, and no notice of dissatisfaction has been given by either Party within 28 days after it received the DAB's decision, then the decision shall become final and binding upon both Parties.\u201d\n\nICC 26834 ~ Final Award\n\n96 -\n\n26. IssuE C2: DO THE TIME-CHAINAGE DIAGRAMS DEMONSTRATE ANY ENTITLEMENT TO PROLONGATION COSTS?\n\nClaimant\u2019s submissions\n\n26.1 The Claimant contended'\" that on the basis of facts which had been admitted by the Respondent, it prepared \u201ctime-chainage\u201d diagrams which showed the progress of the work, and the delay events which were attributable to the Respondent. A diagram was provided for each section of the work. The documents from which the facts were taken are mentioned in the diagrams, and the detailed facts are also contained in the Claimant\u2019s List of Dates.\n\n26.2 It also said'\u2122 that in linear projects such as this, a time-chainage diagram is considered the best and the easiest way of locating the problems, and that is why the Claimant plotted all the delay events from the documents to show where the problems were. It can be seen without any analysis that all the problems were the Respondent\u2019s.\n\n26.3 Volume III of the Claimant\u2019s February 2024 submissions consisted of about 100 pages of detailed diagrams and supporting tables. By way of an example, Annexure 19, the time- chainage diagram for the section between Bhagega and Dabla, is reproduced below:\n\n0 BHAGEGA To DABLA.\n\nRespondent\u2019s submissions\n\n26.4 The Respondent\u2019s position'' was that these diagrams were not an analysis, but merely a representation or plotting of the project data (which has not been verified by the Respondent). It was not a critical path analysis at all, and this was confirmed by the Claimant (Transcript, Day 7, page 39: \u201cthe time chainage we are pointing out is not a critical path analysis\u201d).

        "ground_truth": "SPLL faced coordination issues with Nominated Subcontractors due to delays in construction works, which were partly caused by RMC plant delays. These delays affected scheduling and communication as the Nominated Subcontractors did not receive work front areas on time, leading to reduced labor headcounts and lagging progress. For instance, Speciality Construction Chemicals (Pvt) Ltd. highlighted that they required working clearance for various levels and areas, which were delayed, impacting their ability to increase labor and use machinery effectively.

(2eng.,12tech)287\n\n251.1.\n\nBEST continued to report the reinstallation of removed conduits in the following\n\n2 days, i.e., 11 and 12 February 2016.288\n\n252. Accordingly, based on the above, the reworks to conduit installation appears to have affected\n\nthe progress of small electrical works from 30 January 2016 to 12 February 2016 (i.e.,\n\n13 days).\n\nCable trench works\n\n253. From my review of the baseline programme, there was no specific activity for cable trench\n\nworks such as installation of cable trays and cable trench covers.\n\n254. However, as shown in Figure 102 below, due to the proximity of the 400kV GIS equipment and\n\nthe cable trenches, it would be practical to sufficiently complete the cable trench works to\n\nenable the installation of the 400kV GIS equipment:\n\nFigure 102: My mark\u2010up of site photograph dated 29 March 2016.289\n\n287 BEST Daily Reports dated 10 February 2016 [R\u201014]. 288 BEST Daily Reports dated 11 February 2016 to 12 February 2016 [R\u201014]. 289 POSCO Daily Report dated 29 March 2016 [R\u201020].\n\n25 January 2024\n\nPage 88 of 99\n\nBazyan 400kV Substation BEST \u2010and\u2010 POSCO Appendix 4: LD 6: 400kV GIS Installation Work Complete\n\n255. On 16 November 2015, included covering the open holes on the floor of the GIS room, which I\n\nunderstand includes the cable trenches:\n\nFigure 103: Extract from mandatory pre\u2010check list of works dated 16 November 2015.290\n\n255.1.\n\nBased on the above, it appears that temporary covering of the cable trenches with\n\nwooden plates would be sufficient to enable the start of GIS installation works.\n\n256. Furthermore, on 24 December 2015, POSCO emailed BEST stating that \u201c\u2026Building finishing\n\nand trench should be finished early for electrical equipment installation and cable pulling\u201d.291\n\n[Emphasis added]\n\n257. In addition, within POSCO\u2019s 25 September 2015 programme update (just prior to completion\n\nof the ground floor slab), the completion of the cable trenches, installation of trays and then\n\ncovers was a predecessor sequence to the 400kV GIS equipment installation.292\n\n258. Accordingly, based on the above, and absent a detailed baseline programme that sufficiently\n\ndetails the planned sequence of work, it is reasonable to suggest that the cable trench works\n\n(i.e., installation of cable trays and cable trench covers) were also planned to progress in the\n\n31\u2010day period between the completion of the ground floor (12 August 2015) and the\n\ncommencement of the 400kV GIS installation works (12 September 2015).293\n\n259. Figure 104 below shows the progress of the cable trench works in the 119\u2010day period from\n\n22 October 2015 to 17 February 2016:\n\n290 2015 11 16 \u2010 BS\u2010POS\u2010BST\u2010E\u20100452 [R\u2010133]. 291 2015 12 24 \u2010 BS\u2010POS\u2010BST\u2010E\u20100505 [R\u2010145]. 292 2015 09 25 \u2010 POSCO programme update, Activity IDs C1CCUBS030184 (Ground Level Roof Girder & Slab Con'c Pouring + Curing), C1CEACA033010 (Cable Pit Cable Tray Inst.), C1CCUBS030216 (Check Plate Inst.
